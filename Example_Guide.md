## Tools

- Have a list of tools here
- Links to tools are also great

## Step 1: Name of the step

### Using subtitles is great to break a step into smaller pieces

Make sure button presses like `Start + Up` and `A` have back ticks around themm.

```
Note: If you need to leave a larger side note, use three back ticks.

Make sure there is a new line before and after the three back ticks.
```

## Step 2: Make as many steps as you need

### Different types of lists

Use bullets to:

- Make an unordered list
- Provide a few pieces of info for something

Use numbered lists to:

1. Describe an ordered process
2. If you use words like 'first', 'then', and 'finally', use a numbered list

## Additional notes

This is a great place to have additional notes
