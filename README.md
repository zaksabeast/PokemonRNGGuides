### This is a temporary readme to describe how this repository will be structured.

All of the guides will be in markdown.  Please refer to [the example guide](Example_Guide.md) for tips on how to write your guide.

### Structure of the repository

```

### If you have write access to the repository
Please make a new branch titled `<game>/<language>/<type>` and add your guide there before doing a pull request to the master branch.  **NEVER WRITE TO THE MASTER BRANCH DIRECTLY**.

When a pull request is made, this allows other people to review the guide, make sure it looks clean and is clear to understand.  **At least one person needs to approve the guide before the pull request is merged**.

Do not be afraid of comments or critiques on your guide.  We all want the best possible guides for our community. :)

### Regarding Labels for Pull Requests and Issues

To keep everything organized there are labels for both Pull Requests and Issues.

## Issues

If you are planning on writing or editing a guide, please open an issue detailing what guide you are going to write or edit. This way others will know not to duplicate.

- **Create Guide:** Use this if adding a guide.
- **Edit Guide:** Use this if editing a guide that is already in the repository.

## Pull Requests

There are labels depending on what stage PRs are in. Please edit the labels appropriately as needed.

- **Pending Review:** Needs someone to review and request changes if needed.
- **Changes Requested:** Has been reviewed and is waiting for requested changes to be made.
- **Awaiting Review:** Changes have been made and is now waiting to be reviewed again, and merged if adequate.
