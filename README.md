### If you have write access to the repository
Please make a new branch titled `<game>/<language>/<type>` and add your guide there before doing a pull request to the master branch.  **NEVER WRITE TO THE MASTER BRANCH DIRECTLY**.

When a pull request is made, this allows other people to review the guide, make sure it looks clean and is clear to understand.  **At least one person needs to approve the guide before the pull request is merged**.

Do not be afraid of comments or critiques on your guide.  We all want the best possible guides for our community. :)
