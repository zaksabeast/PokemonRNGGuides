## Tools

- Start with a list of tools needed for the RNG.

## Step 1: The Title

Add context to start.

1. Ordered lists should have numbers.
2. The second thing.
3. The third thing.

- Unordered lists should use dashes.
- Try to avoid nested line items when possible.
- Any time there are console button presses, put those in \`single ticks\`.
- Any time there are web app button presses, put those in "double quotes".
- Common Pokemon values, like seeds and pids, should be in hdex, use single ticks, and not be prefixed with `0x`: `AABBCCDD`.
- Avoid new lines in between list items.
- Always end line items with full stops, unless the line is one or two words.
- Single

```
Sometimes we add notes if there's a helpful tip or tidbit in triple ticks.
```

Use tables for comparisons:

| Item             | Value proposition |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| RNG method       | Good for X        |
| Different method | Good for Y        |

Also use tables to show lists of data:

| Pokemon    | Obtain from     |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Charmander | Professor Oak   |
| Abra       | Above Cerulean  |
| Golem      | Trade Evolution |

## Step 2: Terminology

- Prefer "Advance" over "Frame" for newer guides.

If desired and applicable at the end of the guide, add a "Congrats! You've now got your Pok√©mon!" message.
