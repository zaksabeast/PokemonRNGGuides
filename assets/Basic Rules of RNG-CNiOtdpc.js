Note: You might encounter Vblank issues with wild Pokémon, resulting in Method H-2 or H-4, but this is a rare occurrence.

## Intro

Ruby and Sapphire may have fewer tips than FRLG or Emerald due to the Live Battery method, but there are still valuable insights to share.

## Speeding Up RNG Advances

Ruby and Sapphire have limited options for speeding up RNG advances compared to Emerald, Fire Red, or Leaf Green. However, like any Gen 3 game, being in a battle doubles the RNG advancement speed, which is useful for wild Pokémon RNG.

### Painting RNG

Although it's not very useful for Live Battery, the Painting method does work in Ruby and Sapphire. As it's more advanced, it will be covered in a separate guide.
