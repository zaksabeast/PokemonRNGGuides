## Method 1: Have a friend use CaptureSight

**Use this method if you have Nintendo online and know someone with a custom firmware Switch.**

There are two ways to use CaptureSight: by hosting a raid, or by trading a caught Pokemon.

For this method do not save after starting the raid, or entering the trade.

### Method 1A: Host the raid

1. Save the CFWless switch in front of the den and host the raid.
2. Have the CFW switch join the raid.
3. On the CFW switch, press the \`Home\` button and load CaptureSight.
4. View the raid Pokémon in the "Wild Pokémon" menu and click the "Find Seed" button for the raid Pokémon.
5. Have the CFWless switch restart the game without saving.
6. If it's not a good seed, either beat the raid or use a new wishing piece. Then try again.

### Method 1B: Start a trade

1. Have the CFWless switch catch a raid Pokémon.
2. Have the CFWless switch join a trade with the CFW switch.
3. On the CFW switch, press the \`Home\` button and load CaptureSight.
4. View the raid Pokémon in the "Wild Pokémon" menu and click the "Find Seed" button for the trade Pokémon.
5. Do not trade the Pokémon and exit the trade so the CFWless switch doesn't save.
6. Restart the game on the CFWless switch so the den's seed is reset and can be RNG'd.

## Method 2: Find a Discord server with a Sysbot

Various Discord servers have Sysbots that can automatically trade and dump a Pokemon's info to find raid seeds that way. You can search online for Discord servers running Sword & Shield Sysbots. currently running Sysbots for Sword & Shield raid seeds.

You'll need to catch the raid Pokémon and trade it to the bot. In most cases, the bot will reply with the Pokemon's info and den seed.

## Method 3: Use SeedSearcher

If the other options are not available, then your only option is to try this method to find a raid seed yourself. This takes time and may need multiple tries, so it's recommended to try the other options first.

Keep in mind, the program is very CPU/GPU intensive and can cause your computer to run very hot.
