We're a small group of passionate developers and longtime fans who never really stopped playing. We grew up with link cables, Game Boy colors glowing under blankets at night, and hours spent resetting for that perfect shiny. Now we build the tools we wish we had back then—modern, fast, and available on any device—so you can get the Pokémon you want, how you want.

Whether you're doing your first RNG, hunting for flawless shinies, trying to recreate your childhood team, or just want to learn how it all works—we're here for it. We don't judge how you play.
Retail, emulator, flashcart, patched ROMs—we support it all, because the joy of Pokémon belongs to everyone.

We're fans building the best site, videos, and content we can, with help from an incredible community. Our guides, tools, and videos are made with care, and we're constantly improving them based on your feedback.

If you've ever smiled seeing a sparkle, recreated your old Silver version team, or just wanted to make the game feel a little more yours—you're in the right place.

Come join us. Let's make Pokémon fun again.
Let's make it yours.
