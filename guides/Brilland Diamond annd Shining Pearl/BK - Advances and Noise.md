Note : This guide is really something general and it might be updated if we can find anything in the future, or could even lead to more guides. So take this as an early state guide.

In this game, Noise and Advances are linked. When you run the game, the states will advance by themself. This guide will explain how the noise can be a huge problem at the moment, how to use that to our advantage in order to hit our targets.

## Noise

First, a little word about noise. In what we call a "quiet" place like the player's room, only your character is present, so the states advances in a simple way, 1by1 and is really easy to keep track in order to hit your target. These places are ideal atm for us to RNG. This applies to any method. 

In this game, NPC and any element around will create noise. It'll advance frames faster but also will make them advance by a bigger amount, and other factors (like the character fidgeting) will make these amount of advances per state increasing making your target almost impossible to be hit. So yes, at the moment (the key word) it means that some Pokemon / places are NOT possible to RNG, but this should change in the future.

Another positive point : Some areas can be predicted in a easy way. Frames will advances by a fix amount, making them as simple to hit. Opening the menu / the bag will allow these advances to be more stable. The player will not fidget and will help a lot. For example, in the Eterna Forest, it is possible to have a consistent 5 by 5 advance, and by closing / opening the menu, you'll be able to adjust this until being in the same multiple of frames as your target.

The best solution at the moment is to find places where it is quiet enough to do your RNG. Caves are pretty much the ideal place for that.

## How to advance your states

One is linked to the other. Maybe we've missed some ways but here're some methods to advance your states :

- Going to a noisy area. Not the best since you'll have to go back to your target location etc once close to your target. But if you're next to one, this is a solution
- Using the Trainer Card. Does some fast advances once every 100 / 200 frames. Take care of closing way earlier.
- The most effective one : The Pokdex. Switching between Pokemon will increases the advances by huge numbers. Also staying in front of Aipom / Azelf's info increase advances by a lot. Usable anywhere. Really advised.
