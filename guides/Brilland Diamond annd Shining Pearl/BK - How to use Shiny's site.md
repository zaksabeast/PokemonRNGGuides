This guide will help to discover the Chatot website, how to input every information given by CaptureSight in order to setup your RNG Abuse in Brillant Diamond and Shining Pearl.

Requirement :
- Having CaptureSight (or any other method once supported) set up and ready to be used
- https://chatot.pokemonrng.com/#/bdsp Chatot site 
- Brillant Diamond / Shining Pearl with the last version.

First, we'll look at the website and how it works :

When opening it, you'll find out the wild, the stationary and the underground tab. Go to the method you want for your RNG. In each case, you can start to input your infos such as the delay, the min / max advances wanted etc. You can find more informations about how to fill specific informations (like delays or tiles) in each particular guide. You can also search for the specific filters

Once everything is setting up as wanted, only seeds are missing.

Just launch the game, and once in the title screen open the Tesla Menu. Open CaptureSight, and go to "Main RNG". Write the 4 Seeds in the Chatot site. The seeds are in order so the first seed of capturesight = seed 0 etc. It's important to do it there because it stays at 0, and you can keep track of everything in a safe way without wondering if you have to adjust advances etc. 

Note : If by mistake, during a RNG you lose track of your advances, just relaunch the Tesla Menu, and try to freeze the Main RNG at 0 by pressing A. If you get that, you can input the new seeds and keep track of everything again without failing. 

Once done, hit generate. And you'll know which frame to hit.

On the Switch press the D-Up button, that will allow you to control the game again (if you want to control the overlay press the same button again)

Now you're done you can advance your frames and do your RNG
