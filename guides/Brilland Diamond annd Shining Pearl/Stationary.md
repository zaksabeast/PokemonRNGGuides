Important note : we're looking for more delays and Last screen (aka last input before the game generates a spread) for these Pokemon. Don't hesitate to open an issue here, or send a message on the discord with any Delay / informations based on the Chatot site.

For this guide, we'll assume that you know how to use CaptureSight and Chatot site to setup everything. We'll assume you know how to advance your states and understand how the noise works and how to deal with it. For these, you'll have to use the Stationary tab of the Chatot site. Don't forget to check "Set IVs" if the Pokemon has 3IVs guaranteed. In this guide, it'll be stated next to the Pokémon.

The goal of that guide is more to provide basic informations about delays, any specific setup etc. Everything else has been covered with the basic knowledge guides.

Also it's important to set up a gender rate if you don't aim for a Genderless Pokémon (and the opposite applies if you aim a Genderless Pokemon). The generation uses a check there, so skipping that would lead to different results for the Nature of the Pokemon.

# List of Stationary

Starters :
- Delay : 64
- Generation : "Yes" when you chose the starter in the bag
- Notes : Save before entering in the Lake. It takes around 300 frames to do the cutscene and being able to select your starter with the fast speed. Adjust if you have another setup. But the noise before the Lake will help you to hit the frame in a easy way since no Pokedex

Rotom :
- Delay : 90
- Generation : "You thumped the TV Set"

Dialga / Palkia (3IVs) : 
- Delay : 84
- Generation : After text

Giratina (3IVs) :
- Delay : 84 
- Generation : "Bishaaan!"

Ramanas Park (3IVs) : 
- Delay : 84
- Generation : Dialog Box

/!\ Warning : The following method doesn't work at 100% with the actual tools. It doesn't change the how to RNG it, but could lead to wrong results. /!\

Mystery Gift (Can be 3IVs) :
- Delay : 0
- Generation : The moment when you SELECT the event in the menu where you can chose what to claim.
- Notes : Similar to egg RNG, where you claim it is important. So the best place to do that is in the player's room, where everything is quiet.
