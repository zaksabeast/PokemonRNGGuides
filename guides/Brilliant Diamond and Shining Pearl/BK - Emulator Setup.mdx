## Tools

- [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php)
- [Yuzu](https://yuzu-emu.org/downloads/) or [Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.org/download)
- Updated game to version 1.1.1 or higher

## Usage

- Open Yuzu or Ryujinx, run the game, and pause it at the title screen.
- Open Cheat Engine, click on `Edit > Settings`, select `Scan Settings`, and check the `MEM_MAPPED` option.
- Click on `File > Open Process` and select the Yuzu or Ryujinx process (Yuzu looks like `xxxx-yuzu xxx | game name`, Ryujinx looks like `xxxx-Ryujinx x.x.xxxx - game name`).
- Click on `Table > Show Cheat Table Lua Script`. A new window called `Lua Script: Cheat Table` will appear.
- Open [BDSP_RNG.lua](https://github.com/Real96/BDSP-CheatEngine-Lua) with a text editor, copy all its content, and paste it in the window that just opened.
- Click `Execute Script`. It will freeze for a bit, just wait until it prints all the RNG info in a new window.

## Notes

- To change the info view tab mode, press the keys shown in the script output.
- If you want to stop the script, press `0` or `NumPad 0`. It won't stop otherwise.
- If you want to restart the game, follow the previous steps and then restart the game and the script. It won't work otherwise.
- To avoid text flickering, make sure to enlarge the `Lua Engine` window enough.
