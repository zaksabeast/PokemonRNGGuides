## Tools

- [Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.app/download)
- [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php)
- [BDSP_RNG.lua](https://github.com/Real96/BDSP-CheatEngine-Lua)
- Updated game to version 1.1.1 or higher

## Usage

1. Open Ryujinx, run the game, and pause it at the title screen.
2. Open Cheat Engine, click on `Edit > Settings`, select `Scan Settings`, and check the `MEM_MAPPED` option.
3. Click on `File > Open Process` and select the Yuzu or Ryujinx process.
   - Yuzu looks like `xxxx-yuzu xxx | game name`.
   - Ryujinx looks like `xxxx-Ryujinx x.x.xxxx - game name`.
4. Click on `Table > Show Cheat Table Lua Script`. A new window called `Lua Script: Cheat Table` will appear.
5. Open the `BDSP_RNG.lua` for your game version, copy all its content, and paste it in the window that just opened.
6. Click `Execute Script`. It will freeze for a bit, just wait until it prints all the RNG info in a new window.

## Notes

- To change the info view tab mode, press the keys shown in the script output.
- If you want to stop the script, press `0` or `NumPad 0`. It won't stop otherwise.
- If you want to restart the game, follow the previous steps and then restart the game and the script. It won't work otherwise.
- To avoid text flickering, make sure to enlarge the `Lua Engine` window enough.
