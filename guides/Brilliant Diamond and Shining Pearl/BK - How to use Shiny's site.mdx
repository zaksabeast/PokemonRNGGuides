This guide will help you use the Chatot website to set up RNG Abuse in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.

## Tools

- CaptureSight or Luas for Ryujinx/Yuzu set up and ready to go.
- Visit the Chatot site at https://chatot.pokemonrng.com/#/bdsp.
- Brilliant Diamond or Shining Pearl with the latest version.

## Step 1: Using the Website

When you open the website, you'll see the wild, stationary, and underground tabs. Select the method you want to use for RNG. Input your data like the delay, min/max advances, etc. You can find more details about filling specific information in dedicated guides and search for specific filters.

Once everything is set up, you just need the seeds.

1. If you're using CaptureSight: Launch the game and, at the title screen, open the Tesla Menu. Open CaptureSight and go to "Main RNG." Enter the 4 seeds into the Chatot site. The seeds are in order, so the first seed in CaptureSight is seed 0. This method keeps track of everything safely.
2. If you're using Luas: Enter the values shown in the Initial Seed section. They appear in the same order as the website. Ensure that the StateSize is set to `u32`. If it's in `u64`, press `3` to switch to the correct mode.

```
Note: If you lose track of your advances during RNG, relaunch the Tesla Menu and try to freeze the Main RNG at 0 by pressing `A`. If successful, you can input new seeds and keep track again without issues.
```

## Step 2: Generate

Once done, hit generate to find out which frame to hit.

Press the `D-Up` button on the Switch to regain control of the game (press the same button again to control the overlay).

Now you're ready to advance your frames and complete your RNG!
