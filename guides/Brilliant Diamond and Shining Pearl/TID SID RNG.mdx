This guide will allow you to RNG the TID / SID combinaison of your choice. Both are linked, so one frame will give both TID and SID. You'll need to have read the Basic Knowledge guides, especially the PokeFinder one, since it'll be the tool used for that guide.

Requirement :

- PokeFinder Builds
- CaptureSight

Open your game. With CaptureSight, get the states. Open PokeFinder, go to Gen 8 tab and click on TID / SID.

Generate the results. Take care that it's a really slow RNG. So you'll try to avoid to go for too high frames. No delay is necessary on that RNG.

The TID / SID gets generated once pressing Yes when you validate your name. However, the states are frozen at the name screen. So pretty much, you must hit your target when you select your player's hair and stye.

To advance states, you'll have the Munchlax of the intro blinking, allowing to +1.

However, you can advance your states by +5 or +6 by retruning to the Hat menu after selecting your Name. It'll allow to get to your target faster.
