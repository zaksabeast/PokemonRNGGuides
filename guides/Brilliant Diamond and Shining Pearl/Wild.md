For this guide, we'll assume that you know how to use CaptureSight and Chatot site to setup everything. We'll assume you know how to advance your states and understand how the noise works and how to deal with it. For these, you'll have to use the Wild tab of the Chatot site.

The goal of that guide is more to provide basic informations about delays, any specific setup etc. Everything else has been covered with the basic knowledge guides.

Also it's important to set up a gender rate if you don't aim for a Genderless Pokémon (and the opposite applies if you aim a Genderless Pokemon). The generation uses a check there, so skipping that would lead to different results for the Nature of the Pokemon.

### Pure Wild (Honey)

- Delay : 1 (2 for Unown)
- Notes : It's important to use Honey. Sweet Scent could lend for something less stable. Just press A on the "Use" message at the right frame.

For the encounter slots, you can find them here at the moment : https://www.pokemon-element-sh.fr/encounters-slots
It's in french, but they are trustable. If the site doesn't work : https://www.pokebip.com/page/jeuxvideo/dossier_shasse/encounter_slot

If you are a PokeFinder user (Gen 8 Tab => Wild), the Encounter Tables are available, so you can check what Pokemon are available only with the tool by filling all the informations necessary (like the route). Don't forget to edit your profile if you have a swarm or something like that.

### Honey Tree

- Delay : ??? (not really sure would need numbers here)
- Notes : Just press A in front of the tree. It's suggested to do that RNG with the first tree in Floaroma town where you get the Honey. The area is quiet to make this RNG easy. As for Gen 4, the Pokemon species will be set when putting the honey, but the Pokemon's informations will be generated once encountering it. So you can't go for a specific Pokemon, but you can get the Pokémon attracted the caratecristics you want.

### Fishing

- Delay : 1 (double check is appreciated)
- Notes : Press A on the "Landed a Pokémon!" message

Little reminder, for Feebas, you can use this tool : https://lincoln-lm.github.io/JS-Finder/Tools/BDSPFeebas.html in order to find your tiles.
