So first we say thank to Fish for the tool.

Explain the different tabs briefly. Explain that some cases will be focused more on their own guide like eggs or TID / SID.

Explain the generator / searcher options, how to use Encounter Slots, Generator, how to explain that Searcher can be used to calibrate (maybe define it here too ?)

Done
