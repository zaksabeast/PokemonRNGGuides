Introduction: This guide will explain how to do some PokeRadar RNG. No more researcher necessary, no more difficult setup. It'll work in two parts. The first one will be how to RNG a Pokemon with no chain which is something new. The other will be more classic with a chain setup. It's the more classic way, but now easier. As always this guide will assume that you have solid knowledge on Gen 4 RNG. This guide can be followed emu or retail, like for pretty much any specific RNG guide.
```

## Tools

- [This specific build of PokeFinder](https://mega.nz/file/cwY10TqT#qZxPCoSMGo64Xrw6TdAywqbBeUOk0il53MavrFqKr0Q) done by Real.96. It'll be merged with the main PokeFinder in the future
- Some repels, a target.


## 0-Chain case

For the reference, it'll be called the 0-Chain case. It means that we'll not work around Shiny Patches. It's more restrictive in results being more closer to a regular wild, however it's way easier to setup if you want to go for a fast RNG.

- Open PokeFinder. We assume that the profile setup is done. => Gen 4 => Wild => Searcher
- On the "Settings" tab, check PokeRadar and the route + Pokemon. **Don't check PokeRadar Shiny or Shiny Patch !**
- Input your filters and search for a result. Be careful to select only one encounter slot.
- Go in game, hit your initial seed.
- Launch the PokeRadar as soon as possible and go next to your patch.
- Advance until being a few advance off. **It might be advance perfect but sometimes, you'll have a little offset between the frame you walk in and the actual result. Just adjust**
- Close the menu and advance to your patch. Tada, you got your RNG done.


## 1-Chain case

This one is more basic. This will allow us to use the Shiny Chained Spreads and be more comfortable in results. But the drawback is that more setup is necessary. 

- Open PokeFinder. Gen 4 => Wild => Searcher
- On the Setting tab, check PokeRadar and the route + Pokemon. **This time, check PokeRadar Shiny AND Shiny Patch !**
- Input your filters and search for a result. Be careful to select only one encounter slot. The Advances is the spread that will give the IVs, the nature etc. The Shiny Patch will be the advance that will give the Shiny Patch to spawn.

```
Important : Since you'll need to defeat a Pokemon, and then walk enough to retrigger the PokeRadar, it's important to take that in consideration. You should search for a Spread Range of like 300 - 500 (or more of course). Also, selecting a Shiny Patch that is around 200 Frames is IMPORTANT. Anything under will be not hittable and impossible for you.
```

- In game, hit your initial seed. Trigger the PokeRadar and find the Pokemon of your chain. Defeat it.
- Walk until the PokeRadar is setup.
- Advance frames until being on your Shiny Patch Advance. **Be sure to be on a big Grass Patch since it'll be the highest range as possible. You can search in a 2 by 2 frame range in order to find a closer Shiny Patch.**
- The Shiny Patch should be there. Go next to it and open the bag.
- Advance until being close to your target.  **It might be advance perfect but sometimes, you'll have a little offset between the frame you walk in and the actual result. Just adjust**
- Close the menu and advance to your patch. Tada, you got your RNG done.
