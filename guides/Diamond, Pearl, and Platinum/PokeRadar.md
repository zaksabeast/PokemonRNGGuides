## Requirements

- [This specific build of PokeFinder](https://mega.nz/file/cwY10TqT#qZxPCoSMGo64Xrw6TdAywqbBeUOk0il53MavrFqKr0Q) done by Real.96. It'll be merged with the main PokeFinder in the future
- Some repels

## Intro

This guide explains how to do PokeRadar RNG in two parts: the "0-Chain case" for simple RNG and the "1-Chain case" for more advanced results. This guide assumes you know the basics of Gen 4 RNG and guide works for both emulated and retail play.

## 0-Chain Case

In this case, we don't mess with Shiny Patches. It's more like regular wild encounters but easier to set up quickly.

1. Launch PokeFinder, assuming profile setup is done, and open Gen 4 => Wild => Searcher.
1. On the "Settings" tab, set PokeRadar, route, and Pokémon. **Don't check the PokeRadar Shiny or Shiny Patch boxes.**
1. Input filters and find a result, selecting one encounter slot.
1. In the game, hit your initial seed.
1. Start the PokeRadar and get near your patch.
1. Advance a bit (it might not be perfect), then close the menu and go to your patch. Your RNG done.

## 1-Chain Case

This one allows for Shiny Chained Spreads but requires more setup.

1. Launch PokeFinder, assuming profile setup is done, and open Gen 4 => Wild => Searcher.
1. On the Settings tab, check PokeRadar, route, and Pokémon. **Check the PokeRadar Shiny and Shiny Patch boxes.**
1. Input filters, selecting one encounter slot. Advances is for IVs, nature, etc., and Shiny Patch is for the Shiny appearance.

```
Note: Consider you'll need to defeat a Pokémon, walk to reset the PokeRadar, and search for a Spread Range of about 300-500 or more. Also, select a Shiny Patch around 200 advances. Anything less won't work.
```

1. In-game, hit your initial seed. Trigger the PokeRadar, find your chain's Pokémon, and defeat it.
1. Walk until the PokeRadar resets.
1. Advance the RNG to your Shiny Patch. Find a big Grass Patch for the best results. Search within a 2 by 2 advance range for a closer Shiny Patch.
1. The Shiny Patch should appear. Stand next to it and open your bag.
1. Advance near your target (adjust if needed), then close the menu and head to your patch.
