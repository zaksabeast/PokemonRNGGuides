Introduction : This guide isn't really about helping to RNG something, but more to achieve a setup for a RNG. This guide works for either Emulator or Retail. It'll require the user to have all the basic knowledge of Gen 4 RNG (especially the methods and how to hit an initial seed)

## Trophy Garden

This part will focus on how to get the right daily Pokémon. It's really easy. You'll just have to save in front of the owner of the garden, and reload your setup with **any initial seed**. Open PokeFinder, Static, Method 1, generate results.

You'll have to look at the first value of the PID at your current Advance. Based on the following, table, you'll know which Pokémon will be available once you'll trigger the conversation with the owner :

| PID | Pokemon   |
| --- | -------   |
| 0   |Eevee      |
| 1   |Bonsly     |
| 2   |Happiny    |
| 3   |Meowth     |
| 4   |Cleffa     |
| 5   |Clefairy   |
| 6   |Igglybuff  |
| 7   |Plusle     |
| 8   |Jigglypuff |
| 9   |Porygon (DP) / Ditto(Pt) |
| A   |Castform |
| B   |Minun    |
| C   |Mime Jr. |
| D   |Marill   |
| E   |Chansey  |
| F   |Azurill  |

```
Note : Because of indexation between tools, you might be one off. You just have to adjust.

```
Note : Reminder that the Pokémon of the day will take the Encounter Slot 6 and the previous one will now be the Encounter Slot 7
