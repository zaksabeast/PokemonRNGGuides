## Requirements

- PokeFinder
- Be in front of your target
- All the tools necessary to RNG Abuse with DesMuMe

## Intro

In this guide, our focus is to provide a list of PokÃ©mon and point out any unique characteristics they may have. The RNG process remains constant, and once you've reviewed both the Initial Seed Guide and the Advancing guide, you'll have the fundamentals in place.

Please make sure that PokeFinder is opened under Gen 4 => Static.

## Method K List

- Drifloon
- Spiritomb
- Rotom
- Uxie, Azelf
- Dialga, Palkia
- Heatran
- Regigigas
- Giratina
- Darkrai (Platinum)
- Shaymin (Platinum)
- Arceus (Platinum)
- Regirock, Regice, Registeel (Platinum)

```
Note: If you want to RNG Giratina on the Distortion World, it's tricker. When you load the Distortion world, the RNG advances by 11, then you have 12 advances when encountering Giratina. So you have to consider that it has a initial advance of 23 since you'll have the Distortion world load at least once if you do journal method.
```

## Method 1 List

- Sinnoh Starters
- Eevee from Bebe
- Happiny Egg
- Riolu Egg
- Cresselia (initial advance of 5)
- Mesprit (initial advance of 5)
- Porygon (Platinum)
- Moltres (Platinum)
- Zapdos (Platinum)
- Articuno (Platinum)

```
Note: For Sinnoh Starters in DP, save in the route before entering in the Lake. It'll also be an easier manipulation with a Shiny Target Advance = 0. In Pt it'll be more difficult and have to deal with the noise.
```

```
Note: Cresselia and Mesprit are generated the first time you talk to them, so RNG them before they run away.
```

```
Note: When you talk to Prof Oak for the Kanto birds, Moltres has a initial advance of 1, Zapdos of 6, and Articuno of 11. For these, it's suggested to do the E4 method: defeat your target, then RNG by talking to Oak again.
```

## Manaphy Egg RNG

The Manaphy Egg is received like a Wondercard Pokemon, but it uses the Method 1 generation. The Wondercard follows the usual RNG.

Manaphy has a shiny lock that prevents it from hatching as a shiny in the game it's obtained in. To bypass this, RNG the Manaphy to be hatched shiny in a different game.

1. Know the shiny PID for Game A.
2. In Game B, obtain the egg with that PID.
3. Trade the egg from Game B to Game A.
4. Hatch the egg in Game A.

Congratulations, you now have a shiny Manaphy!
