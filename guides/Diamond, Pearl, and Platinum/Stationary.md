Introduction : In this guide, the idea is more to give a list of Pokemon, is there anything special about these. The RNG itself is always the same and by reading the Initial Seed Guide AND the Advancing guide, the basics are set.
```
## Requirements

- PokeFinder (Gen 4 => 'Static')
- Be in front of your target
- All the tools necessary to RNG Abuse with DesMuMe

## Method K List 
* Drifloon
* Spiritomb
* Rotom
* Uxie, Azelf
* Dialga, Palkia
* Heatran
* Regigigas
* Giratina 
* Giratina (Platinum) : If you want to RNG it on the Distortion World, it's tricker. When you load the Distortion world, the RNG advances by 11 and THEN you have a 12 advance when encountering Giratina. So the idea is to consider that it has a starting frame of 23 since you'll have the Distortion world to load at least once (if you do journal method)
* Darkrai (Platinum)
* Shaymin (Platinum)
* Arceus (Platinum)
* Regirock, Regice, Registeel (Platinum)

## Method 1 List 
* Sinnoh Starters : On DP, just save in the route before entering in the Lake. It'll also easy manipulation with a Shiny Target Advance = 0. In Pt it'll be more difficult and have to deal with the noise
* Eevee from Bebe
* Happiny Egg
* Riolu Egg
* Roamers (/!\ Starting Frames): Cresselia / Mesprit are set to 5. They are generated the first time you talk to them. So you RNG before they run away. For the Kanto Birds (Pt Only), when you talk to Prof Oak, Moltres has a starting frame of 1, Zapdos of 6 and Articuno of 11. For these, it's suggested to do the E4 method. it means to defeat your target, and then RNGing by talking to Oak again
* Porygon (Platinum)


## Manaphy Egg RNG

The Manaphy Egg is received like a Wondercard Pokemon, but it uses the Method 1 generation. The Wondercard follows the usual RNG. It has a shiny check on it that prevents the hatched Manaphy from being shiny normally, but there is a way to bypass this check and get a shiny Manaphy. You'll need to know the PID of the IV spread you're going for. Once you have it, you'll need a save file that isn't the one your Manaphy Wondercard is on, and has this PID shiny. Do the RNG manipulation and receive the Egg, and trade it to this game. Hatch it in the other game and if you did it correctly, you should now have a shiny Manaphy. To summarize, if you want a shiny Manaphy in game A:

1. Find out what shiny PID you have in game A.
2. Get the Egg with the same PID in game B.
3. Trade the Egg from game B to game A.
4. Hatch the Egg in game A.

Congratulations, you now have a shiny Manaphy!
