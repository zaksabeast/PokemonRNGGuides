This guide will assume that you know how to hit use PokeFinder, hit an initial seed and how to advance frames. The guide will cover more the specific cases where you can encounter wild Pokémon in Diamond, Pearl and Platinum.

Except PokeRadar RNG, everything is Method J

## Basic Wild RNG (Sweet Scent)

Nothing special here, get a Pokémon with Sweet Scent, go on the route you want, set up your tool, advances frames and hit your target.
You'll not be able to use

## Sweet Scentless RNG

## Fishing

Important : any lead that allows to boost the fishing rate DOESN'T work. So you'll have to do without it on DPPt.

For Feebas, the idea is to have two consecutive frames to give a bite in order to have it working.

## Honey

The idea is more how to explain how the generation works, how to make a specific Pokémon to spawn, and also to figure out the TID / SID for special trees, hi Munchlax.
