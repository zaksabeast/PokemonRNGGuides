Introduction : This guide will be really short since no real specific case. As always, it'll require the basic knowledge on Gen 4 RNG. How to hit an initial Seed, how to advances your seeding. It'll try to cover the basic methods, some niche stuff to help for specific cases only. This guide obviously works for emulator, retail since they are tips on how to setup / achieve your RNG
```

## General

Before going for specific cases, it's important to find a Target Frame and setup PokéFinder for it :
* Open PokeFinder => Gen 4 => Wild => Seacher. **Be sure to have Method J selected**
* Setup your profile, the route and the Pokemon you want with the right encounter slot.
* Filters with your Criterias and then find your target Frame


## Basic Wild 

For a basic wild, just go to the area wanted. Be sure to have a Pokémon with Sweet Scent. You can either use Honey. 
Nothing else required. Hit your initial seed, open the party, advance and then use Sweet Scent or the Honey without leaving the menu to avoid any noise cancelation.

At the opposite of Gen 5, the Honey / Sweet Scent animation doesn't advance the state, so you're safe.

## GBA Insertions

In that situation, the RNG has nothing different than a basic wild. Just be aware that they use the **Encounter Slot 8 and 9**.
If your profile is well setup, PokeFinder should adjust and display everything correctly.


## Fishing

```
Important : Any lead that allows to boost the fishing rate DOESN'T work. PokeFinder should have taken this in consideration. It's a DPPt bug.
```

Just go to your desired area, and do the setup. Advance frames in the party then go to your bag to use the road. If you're on emulator, if you notice a huge advance, it means that you got a hook and will be a good hint that you hit your target spread.

PokeFinder also shows in the Generator which advances will lead to an encounter ot not.

### Feebas case

Feebas is a more difficult thing. First you'll have to find the right tile. Save, setup your RNG. But before going for it, open the Generator of your PokeFinder and input the initial Seed. Locate your target advance. **Be sure that your target and the consecutive advance leads to an encounter. If it doesn't, it might give you no encounter**

Then Feebas relies on a 50/50 call that isn't supported at the moment. So it's pretty much random.

## Trophy Garden

This RNG is simple. Just setup the Encounter you want based on the "Setting up RNGs" guide. Select the right encounter Slot (6 for today's Pokemon or 7 for yesterday's) and then do your RNG.

## Honey

Honey is the same. The only difficulty is to get the right Pokémon which is also covered on the "Setting up RNGs" guide.

## Great Marsh

That RNG might look intimidating at first, but it's really easy in the end. First, if necessary, use the lookout to get the Pokemon you want. **Like for the Trophy Garden, it'll use Encounter Slot 6 and 7**

Then just save in front of the Great Marsh. When searching for a target be sure to have enough range to hit your target without having the noise while walking to make you fail it.

For the catching, it's more related to Battle Seed and isn't covered in this guide.
