## Intro

This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of Gen 4 RNG, such as hitting an initial seed and advancing the RNG.

## General

Before getting into specifics, determine your target frame and set up PokeFinder like this:

1. Open PokeFinder => Gen 4 => Wild => Searcher. Make sure to select Method J.
2. Set up your profile, including the route and desired Pokémon with the correct encounter slot.
3. Apply your criteria and identify your target advance.

## Basic Wild

For a wild encounter, go to the area with your target Pokémon. You need a Pokémon with Sweet Scent or honey. Follow these steps:

1. Hit your initial seed.
2. Open your party.
3. Advance the RNG.
4. Use Sweet Scent or honey.
5. Avoid leaving the menu to prevent noise cancelation.

Sweet Scent and honey animations won't affect RNG advancement unlike in Gen 5.

## GBA Insertions

GBA insertions follow the same RNG process as basic wild RNG. They use Encounter Slot 8 and 9. If your profile is set up correctly, PokeFinder will show all relevant information automatically.

## Fishing

```
Note: Any methods claiming to boost the fishing rate do not work. PokeFinder should account for this as it's a DPPt bug.
```

1. Go to your desired fishing spot.
2. Advance the RNG in your party.
3. Open your bag and use the fishing rod.

On an emulator, a significant advancement indicates a successful hook and possibly reaching your target encounter. PokeFinder shows which advances lead to an encounter.

### Feebas

Feebas encounters are trickier. Here's what to do:

1. Find the correct tile.
2. Save and set up your RNG.
3. Use the PokeFinder Generator and input the initial seed to find the target advance.
4. Make sure your target and advance result in an encounter; otherwise, you might not encounter anything.

Feebas has an element of randomness that isn't fully supported yet.

## Trophy Garden

1. Stand in front of the garden owner and save your game.
2. Reload with any initial seed.
3. Open PokeFinder, go to Static, Method 1, and generate results.
4. Check the first value of the PID at your current advance.
5. Use the table to see which Pokémon are available when you talk to the owner:

| PID | Pokemon                |
| :-- | ---------------------- |
| 0   | Eevee                  |
| 1   | Bonsly                 |
| 2   | Happiny                |
| 3   | Meowth                 |
| 4   | Cleffa                 |
| 5   | Clefairy               |
| 6   | Igglybuff              |
| 7   | Plusle                 |
| 8   | Jigglypuff             |
| 9   | Porygon (DP)/Ditto(Pt) |
| A   | Castform               |
| B   | Minun                  |
| C   | Mime Jr.               |
| D   | Marill                 |
| E   | Chansey                |
| F   | Azurill                |

```
Note: You might be off by one due to indexing differences between tools. Adjust if needed.
```

```
Note: The Pokémon of the day occupies Encounter Slot 6, and the previous day's Pokémon will be in Encounter Slot 7.
```

## Great Marsh

This process is similar to the Trophy Garden and uses Encounter Slot 6 and 7.

1. Use the lookout to choose your desired Pokémon.
2. Save your game in front of the Great Marsh.
3. Find a target with a narrow enough range that allows hitting the target without introducing RNG noise from walking.
4. Conclude the RNG as usual.
