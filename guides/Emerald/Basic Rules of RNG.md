Emerald has some nice things to make the RNG enjoyable seeding wise. However, vblank just pretty much kills the game.

### Methods

* Stationary : Method 1
* Wild : Method H-2

```
Note : For wild it's really a default method. You could hit up to like 80% of vblank and never know which method you'll hit. And there's no real solution except trying, trying again and losing a stupid amount of time for nothing.
```

### Trainer Card Flip

Doing a Trainer Card Flip in Gen 3 will always allow the game to reset the noise that created delay issues, making the user just to focus on the default delay. For that, you need to go to your trainer Card and press A. **It's a major thing that you should do by reflex.** To make it simple, just do it between 10k - 5k before your target frame. And with that, you'll save you a lot of trouble.


### How to avoid noise as much as possible

Based on the previous tip, a way to avoid vblank and noise as much as possible is just to be open your trainer card when you start your rng, do a flip, close it and advance to your target frame. It might seems simple, but it'll be an effective way to protect you from any bad surprise.

### How to advance frames faster (Seeding help included)

#### Battle Video 

The origins of solutions for Seeding. With that method, you can save any frame (aka any seed) to be an initial Seed. For that you just have to do a battle in the Battle Frontier and save it as a video. It'll keep in memory the Seed when it was done and will allow you to set it up as initial Seed when loading it. For example if your target is at 1M of frames away, you could just go up to 950k, save a battle video. Once loading it you'd start at 950k frames. 

This method was core but it ended up being quite outdated compared to Painting RNG. It still can be usefull if you want to hit a specific frame multiple times.

#### In Battle 

However, like in any  Gen 3 game, being in battle advances the frame two times faster. Always helpful especially for wild RNG.

#### Painting RNG

Just a reminder that this is a thing and will allow you to have any wanted Initial Seed. But since it's more advanced, it's covered on its own guide.
