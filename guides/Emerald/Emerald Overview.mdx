### Practical Applications of RNG Manipulation

Obtaining Pokémon with rare traits (ex: Shiny, perfect IVs, Nature, Ability):
- • Static Pokémon (Easiest to RNG, only way to RNG most Legendary Pokémon)
- • [Wild Pokémon](/retail-emerald-wild) (Only way to RNG Ditto)
- • [Egg Pokémon](/emulator-emerald-egg) (Less wait time for perfect Pokémon)

Accessing Mirage Island (Only way to get Liechi Berry)

Predicting Battle Frontier teams for easy Gold Symbols

Getting Pokérus, which is notably required to get optimal low-level Pokémon such as Level 5 Smeargle with Dragon Rage

Getting big Lotad and Seedot to show to brothers in Sootopolis City

### RNG Manipulation Techniques

- [Finding your SID](/gen3-sid), which is required to RNG manipulate a shiny Pokémon.

- Manipulating your TID/SID, to reduce the wait time for specfic shiny Pokémon.

- Shortening the wait time to reach high RNG advances:

  - [Resetting RNG advances with Painting](/emerald-painting-rng)
  - [Saving and restoring RNG advances with Battle Video](/e-tips-rng)

- Manipulating Pokémon generation with Arbitrary code execution (ACE)

- Improving Pokémon generation consistency by forcing Wild-1 with a lead Pokémon with PID less than 25

- Improving timing accuracy by reducing noise-related delays with [Trainer Card flip](/e-tips-rng)

- Determining the PID of a Pokémon from its IVs
