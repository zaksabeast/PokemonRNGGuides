### Practical Applications of RNG Manipulation

- Obtaining Pokémon with rare traits (ex: Shiny, perfect IVs, Nature, Ability):
  - Static Pokémon (Easiest to RNG, only way to RNG most Legendary Pokémon).
  - [Wild Pokémon](/retail-emerald-wild) (Only way to RNG Ditto).
  - [Egg Pokémon](/emulator-emerald-egg) (Less wait time for perfect Pokémon).
- [Accessing Mirage Island](/emerald-mirage-island) (Only way to get Liechi Berry).
- Predicting Battle Frontier teams for easy Gold Symbols.
- Getting Pokérus, which is notably required to get optimal low-level Pokémon such as Level 5 Smeargle with Dragon Rage.
- Getting big Lotad and Seedot to show to brothers in Sootopolis City.

### RNG Manipulation Techniques

- [Finding your SID](/gen3-sid), which is required to RNG manipulate a shiny Pokémon.
- Manipulating your TID/SID, to reduce the wait time for specfic shiny Pokémon.
- Shortening the wait time to reach high RNG advances:
  - [Resetting RNG advances with Painting](/emerald-painting-rng).
  - [Saving and restoring RNG advances with Battle Video](/e-tips-rng).
- Manipulating Pokémon generation with Arbitrary code execution (ACE).
- Improving Pokémon generation consistency by forcing Wild-1 with a lead Pokémon with PID less than 25.
- Improving timing accuracy by reducing noise-related delays with [Trainer Card flip](/e-tips-rng).
- Determining the PID of a Pokémon from its IVs.
