Gist: Access Mirage Island by catching a Pokémon with the right PID.

## Mirage Island

Accessing Mirage Island is the only way to obtain Liechi Berry. The island is only accessible if the player team has a Pokémon with PID matching a specific pattern. That pattern changes every day, and depends on the number of days since the game savefile was created.

For example, if 3 days have passed, the PID pattern to match is 0xA704\*\*\*\*. If you have a dead battery, the PID to match is always 0x0000\*\*\*\*.

## Step 1: Find the number of days since the game savefile was created

If you have a dead battery, this step is not needed.

Talk to the scientist in the Mossdeep Space Center to know the number of rockets launched. This indicates the number of weeks since your savefile was created.

## Step #2: Catch a Pokémon matching the PID pattern

Fill the form below to find the relevant PID pattern, and the earliest frame for a Pokémon generated with Method-1 to match that pattern.

The Pokémon recommended to catch with Method-1 is any of the stationnary Kecleon, but any will do. Wild Pokémon generated with other Methods also work, but they are harder to RNG manipulate.

Because the rocket launch count only gives an approximation of the days passed (± 7 days), it is recommended to aim for a PID pattern at least 6 days in the future. Otherwise, in the worst case, you'll need to catch 7 Pokémon (one for each day of the week).
