Gist: Access Mirage Island by catching a Pokémon with the right PID.

## Mirage Island

Accessing Mirage Island is the only way to obtain Liechi Berry. The island is only accessible if the player team has a Pokémon with PID matching a specific pattern. That pattern changes every day, and depends on the number of days since the game savefile was created.

## Step 1: Find the number of days since the game savefile was created

If you have a dead battery, this step is not needed.

Talk to the scientist in the Mossdeep Space Center to know the number of rockets launched. This indicates the number of weeks since your savefile was created.

## Step #2: Catch a Pokémon matching the PID pattern

1. Fill the form below to view results.
2. For live battery, choose any result 6 or more days in the future.
3. Catch a Pokémon with Method-1 PID generation on your chosen result's advance.  Kecleon is recommended, but any Method-1 Pokémon will do.

  <Gen3MirageIsland game="emerald" />

<ShowIf slug="/rs-mirage-island">
  <Gen3MirageIsland game="rs" />
</ShowIf>

## Step #3: Visit Mirage Island

Attempt to visit Mirage Island on Route 130 for the next 6 days.  One of the days should have Mirage Island accessible.

Enjoy your Liechi Berry!
