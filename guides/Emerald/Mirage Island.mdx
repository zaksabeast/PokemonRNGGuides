Gist: How to RNG manipulate a Pokémon with the right PID to access Mirage Island

## Mirage Island

Accessing Mirage Island is the only way to obtain Liechi Berry. It is only accessible if the player team has a Pokémon with PID matching a specific pattern. That pattern changes every day, and depends on the number of days since the game savefile was created.

For example, if 3 days has passed, the PID pattern to match is 0xA704\*\*\*\*. If you have a dead battery, the PID to match is always 0x0000\*\*\*\*.

## Strategy
- Find the number of days since the savefile was created by talking to a scientist in the Mossdeep Space Center.
