## Strategy Overview
When creating a new savefile, SID depends the randomly generated TID and the timing of pressing `A` on a specific text.
It isn't humanly possible to control TID because it updates ~280,000 times per second.
The timing of pressing `A` on a specific text has a 1/60 second accuracy.

The strategy to determine the SID is to attempt a timing of 1505 advances. By knowing the TID and that the actual hit advance is near 1505, 
we can generate a list of possible SIDs (one SID for each advance near 1505).

Afterwards, each possible SID must be validated until the right one is found. A SID can be validated by catching a Pokémon that would be shiny is the player has that SID. If that Pokémon isn't shiny, 
then the SID isn't the correct one.

## Step 1: Generate your TID and list of possible SIDs
1. On the title screen, go to Options and set the text speed to `Fast`.
2. Create a New Game, type your name and move the cursor over the `OK` button.
3. Start the TID/SID timers on the website.
4. Exactly when the first timer reaches 0, press `A` to confirm your name.
5. Continue the dialogue until the message `Well, I'll be expecting you later. Come see me in my POKEMON LAB.`.
6. Exactly when the second timer reaches 0, press `A`.
7. Check the TID generated on your trainer card.
8. Fill the "Obtained TID" field on the website and press Generate possible SIDs.
9. Follow the Recommendation below the list which states to either start over Step 1 to generate a better TID, or go to Step 2 with your TID.

## Step 2: Determine the correct SID
Summary: For each possible SID generated in Step 1, obtain a starter Pokémon with its associated earliest Method-1 advance that results in a shiny. 
If the Pokémon you get is not shiny, then its associated SID is not your SID. 

1. Save the game in front of the starter Pokémon bag.
2. On the website, fill the TID and the first possible SID of the list you haven't tried yet.
3. Press Generate, then start the timer.
4. Exactly when the first timer reaches 0, press `Start + Select + A + B` simultaneously to reset the game.
5. Interact with the bag, select your starter, until the confirmation message `Do you choose this POKEMON?`.
6. Exactly when the second timer reaches 0, press `A` to select `YES`.
7. Complete the battle and examine your starter Pokémon.
8. If it's shiny, congratulations! The inputted SID is the SID of your savefile.
9. If it's not shiny, fill the species, gender, nature, and stats in the form below, then press "Find advances matching caught starter Pokémon".
10. <ShowIf slug="/starter-sandbox">If no results is shown, a field is incorrect, or the battery of your cartridge is not dead.</ShowIf><ShowIf slug="/starter-sandbox">
  If no results are shown, a field is incorrect.</ShowIf>
11. If the first row contains `Shiny if correct SID` but the Pokémon you got is not shiny, then the currently tested SID is incorrect. Start over Step 2 using the next SID in the list of possible SIDs.
12. Otherwise, click on the `Update Calibration` button and start over Step 2 with the same SID.
