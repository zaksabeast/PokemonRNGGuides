## Step 2: Determine the correct SID
For each possible SID generated in Step 1, obtain a starter Pokémon with its associated earliest Method-1 advance that results in a shiny. 
If the Pokémon you get is not shiny, then its associated SID is not your SID. 

1. Save the game in front of the starter Pokémon bag.
2. On the website, fill the TID and the first possible SID of the list you haven't tried yet.
3. Press Generate, then start the timer.
4. Exactly when the first timer reaches 0, press `Start + Select + A + B` simultaneously to reset the game.
5. Interact with the bag, select your starter, until the confirmation message `Do you choose this POKEMON?`.
6. Exactly when the second timer reaches 0, press `A` to select `YES`.
7. Complete the battle and examine your starter Pokémon.
8. If it's shiny, congratulations! The inputted SID is the SID of your savefile.
9. If it's not shiny, fill the species, gender, nature, and stats in the form below, then press "Find advances matching caught starter Pokémon".
