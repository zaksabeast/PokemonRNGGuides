Introduction : This guide is more a fitting guide that is really important to make your life easier. You'll find some stuff not really related, some little points but they all will help you to make your life easier.

FRLG does have what will be your best friend for any of your RNG. One of the most powerful tool that you get when you start the game. Except that, vblank is friendly with us. So if you follow these little tips, your RNG experience will improve by a lot !

### Methods

* Stationary : Method 1
* Wild : Method H-1

```
Note : After 13 years of FRLG RNG, i'm still waiting for a vblank doing wild RNG. However, if you want to hit another Method for wild, Sweet Scent Less method (that will be covered on its own guide) seems to work really well.

### Trainer Card Flip

Doing a Trainer Card Flip in Gen 3 will always allow the game to reset the noise that created delay issues, making the user just to focus on the default delay. For that, you need to go to your trainer Card and press A. **It's a major thing that you should do by reflex.** To make it simple, just do it between 10k - 5k before your target frame. And with that, you'll save you a lot of trouble.


### How to avoid noise as much as possible

Based on the previous tip, a way to avoid vblank and noise as much as possible is just to be open your trainer card when you start your rng, do a flip, close it and advance to your target frame. It might seems simple, but it'll be an effective way to protect you from any bad surprise.
