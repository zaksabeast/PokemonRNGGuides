## Intro

FRLG offers an invaluable tool that becomes your best friend for any RNG work. It's one of the most potent tools you receive when starting the game. However, it's important to note that vblank can be tricky to deal with. By following these simple tips, your RNG experience can become much smoother!

## RNG Methods

- For stationary Pok√©mon: Method 1
- For wild encounters: Method H-1

## Speeding Up RNG Advances

### Teachy TV

This item, acquired during the tutorial, can be a game-changer. When you use it, the RNG advances **313 times faster**, making it possible to hit targets millions of advances away within seconds. Get comfortable using it, and it will become your ally.

### In-Battle

As is the case in any Gen 3 game, being in a battle speeds up RNG advancement by a factor of two.

## Trainer Card Flip

In Gen 3, performing a Trainer Card Flip resets the noise-related delays, allowing you to focus on the default delay. It's a crucial step you should do almost reflexively. Simply access your Trainer Card and press A. To keep it simple, do this between 10k-5k advances before your target advance. This can save you a lot of trouble.

## Minimizing Noise

Building on the previous tip, a way to minimize vblank and noise issues is to open your Trainer Card when starting your RNG, perform a flip, close it, and advance to your target advance. This might sound simple, but it's an effective strategy to shield yourself from unexpected surprises.
