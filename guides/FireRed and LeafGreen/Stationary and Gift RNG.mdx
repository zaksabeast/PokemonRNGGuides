## Tools

- VBA-rr
- Lua scripts for FRLG (available [here](https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/15187-gen-3-lua-scripts/?tab=comments#comment-127239) - you'll need to copy the code, paste it to a notepad, and rename the file to 'whatyouwant.lua')
- Knowledge of how to use the Memory Viewer
- RNG Reporter
- Your TID/SID
- A calculator and a notepad
- A way to read your save—PKHeX is recommended

## Step 1: Setup RNG Reporter

1. Open RNG Reporter.
2. Enter your TID/SID.
3. Use Method 1.

```
Note: Pokemon that are Method 1 in FRLG:
Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Clefairy, Abra, Hypno, Voltorb, Electrode, Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, Scyther, Pinsir, Magikarp, Lapras, Eevee, Porygon, Omanyte, Kabuto, Aerodactyl, Snorlax, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Dratini, Mewtwo, Togepi, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Deoxys.
```

## Step 2: Setup VBA

1. Open your emulator.
2. Have a save in front of the stationary Pokémon or the NPC that gives you the Pokémon.
3. Load your Lua script by going to "Tools" => "Lua Scripting" => "New Lua Script". Select the Lua file you saved earlier.

## Step 3: Setup the initial seed

1. Load the game.
2. Enter the "Continue" menu.
3. Pause the emulator to find your initial seed.
   - FRLG generates different spreads each time the game loads, preventing repeats.
4. Open the Memory Viewer and search at the address 0x02020000.

The "1330" is the seed for this run. It changes after pressing `A` or `Start`. You must use what you have.

5. Enter it in the "Seed (Hex)" box in RNG Reporter.
   - Enter your target settings for the Pokémon you want (shiny, IVs, nature, encounter slots, etc.) and hit "Generate".

## Step 4: RNG process

1. Pick a frame to hit in RNG Reporter.
2. Your player should be in front of the right legendary, NPC, or Pokéball.
3. Create a save state to avoid mistakes.

```
Note: Don't hesitate to overuse save states! This allows you to go back to lower frames and adjust since calibration is required every time.
```

4. Advance to the final screen.
   - If the Pokémon has a dialog (like a cry) before the battle, that's the final screen before it's generated. The final screen for wild Pokémon is the cursor on "Sweet Scent". This may vary by case.

## Step 5: Calibration

1. Create a save state.
2. Write down the current frame.
3. Hold the `A` button and unpause the game.
   - This triggers the battle or finishes the dialog for a gift on the final screen.
4. Check the stats of the Pokémon you've found. There are two cases:
   - If it's stationary, the Lua will show all the IVs.
   - If it's a gift, save your game and load it with PKHeX.
5. Reload the save state you made to attempt the RNG again.
   - This keeps the calibration intact while checking the Pokémon's stats.
6. Enter the Pokémon's stats into RNG Reporter to find the frame.
7. Find how many frames you were off by:
   - (Frame you pressed `A`) - (Frame from reporter).
   - It will often be a negative result around 90% of the time, which is normal.
   - For example, if you pressed `A` on frame 100 and hit Pokémon was frame 103, you were off by -3 frames.
8. Add the number of frames you were off to your original frame.
   - If you got a negative number, subtract it from your original frame.
   - This new number is the new frame to press `A` on.

```
Note: You can calibrate whenever you want. For fast targets, doing it near your shiny frame helps. Calibrating too early can cause too low of a delay around your frame, requiring recalibration.
```

## Troubleshooting

If you didn’t hit your target after calibration, retry the calibration step.

- You can use save states to avoid problems.

If you still can't hit anything after a few tries, double-check your setup.

If you followed all steps, the Pokémon will be what you wanted after calibration. Congrats, you did your Gen 3 wild RNG!
