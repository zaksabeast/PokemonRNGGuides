Necessary :

- Vba
- Lua Scripts v2 on noob : https://pokerng.forumcommunity.net/?t=56443955
- PokeFinder
- My doc for delays : https://docs.google.com/document/d/11jxX7bTSGf2vzkdHr-lEpz2bLRI_u7zRbXaOtbasTp0

Okay so little notes :

First these scripts allow a better frame count, and less mistakes. This allows with a little technique to hit any frame without
any calibration. But you need to know the basic delay of the Pokemon in order to do that. i've provided as much data as possible.
If there's some missing, don't hesitate to ping / contact me to add to the list.

Okay so now it's really similar to the v1.

Open your emulator, save in front of the target.

Open PokeFinder, select "Gen 3" => "Stationary" it'll be Method 1. Select your profile.
/!\ In the delay box, check it and add the delay corresponding to your target /!\
Search for a target.

IMPORTANT : More you advance in frames, more you'll be likely have a higher and wrong delay. To avoid that, you need to do a
Trainer Card Flip near your target frame to refresh this and get the basic delay.
For that. Open the menu, go in your trainer Card, press A. It'll flip. It's done.
Do that around 2/3k before your target frame.

Important : You can advance a LOT of frames (talking about 1 Million every 10 seconds with the Teachy TV)

Once the card flip done, go to the last input, once close to the target frame, pause the emulator (ctrl + p), and advance frame by
frame (ctrl + n) to the one shown by PokeFinder. PRess A and unpause at the same time.

Done !
