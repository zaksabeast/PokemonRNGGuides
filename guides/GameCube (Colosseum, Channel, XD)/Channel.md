Introduction : In Gen 3, there're only two ways to RNG Jirachi : Wishmaker and Channel. The first one is way easier, but is limited with spreads. It's time to focus on the latter, using Dolphin and a lot of updates to make the RNG really easier. As always this guide assume a basic knowledge in GC RNG, especially how to hit an initial seed.
```

## Requirements

- A finished save of Channel with the Jirachi option unlocked
- A finished save of Ruby / Sapphire
- Toolbox from Lincoln
- Dolphin-Lua + Channel Lua from Real96

## Setup

* Open Toolbox and go to Gamecube on the main windows.
* Go to "Searcher" without any profile and search for the filters you want.
* Once a spread is found keep track of its Seed.
* Go to Gen 3 Tools => GameCube => GameCube RTC. Input your Origin Seed, your Target Seed. Search for a 10-100 Frames range, but search for a long period of time
* Once a result is found, input the date / time on runasdate and run Dolphin.

## RNG and Advancing

The next step is now to get the Jirachi. Once the Dolphin and the lua are loaded you should see the initial seed to match. Once on the main menu, pause Dolphin.
* Still on Toolbox, Gen 3 Tools => GameCube => Jirachi Advancer
* Input the Current Seed on the Starting Seed box
* Target Seed, input the Jirachi one.
* Max Advances, well input something related to what said earlier, should be 100.
* Leave the Bruteforce Range blank and you don't have to check the "Min Actions box". Then hit generate.

```
Note : It might be possible that no result is found. It's less than common now, but we never know. Just try another initial seed, search etc. But it should be good.
```

Now, if everything was done well, you should have a list of actions. You'll have to do them in the right order. You can adjust at anytime by updating the Origin Seed to see what the actual steps are.

```
Note : If you see "Reload Menu" it means to go to the Options and then pressing B.
```

Once all the steps are done, you just have to claim Jirachi for a last advance and get your desired target.
