## Tools

- Dolphin with Lua support (available on Discord)
- Lua scripts for Gamecube (available on Discord)
- PokeFinder
- PAL-Pal (https://github.com/KapitalRoser/PAL-Pal) by Kapital#9267
- A new save of PAL XD
- List of shiny Eevee spreads by Parzival#3035 (https://pastebin.com/0Dh740Kg) for Method 2
- RunAsDate (x64) for Method 2

## Intro

This guide covers two methods to RNG Eevee in PAL XD. Choose based on your needs: one with a known Eevee spread list using Initial Seed RNG, and a simpler method using any Initial Seed for more random spreads.

This guide assumes basic knowledge of emulator setup and Initial Seed RNG for PAL XD.

```
Note: This guide only works for PAL XD; it doesn't apply to the NTSC version.
```

## Advancing the RNG

Understand how to advance the RNG since the PAL version freezes in the name menu. Use these methods:

1. Rerolls: Triggered in the main menu by going to "VS Mode" => "Quick Battle" => "Battle vs CPU" => Ultimate. Each reroll is when Pok√©mon are shown. Press `No` and redo for multiple advances.
2. Memory Card Reloads: Press `B` and `A` in the main menu to reload Memory Card Data, shown by an in-game message. Each reload counts as +1.
3. Options Saves: Change the Rumbling setting in Settings, save, then return to the main menu.
4. Name Screen Blackout: Start a New Game and press `B` when asked about using a specific name. Do not select a name as it's irreversible.

```
Note: Set your trainer's name when the Current Seed matches your target Seed. Avoid Name Screen Blackout at this point.
```

## Method 1: Using PAL-Pal Only

This method is straightforward for hitting any Eevee not listed but can take time and yield less favorable spreads.

1. Open Dolphin, load the Luas, note the Current Seed in the main menu, and pause the emulator.
2. Open PAL-Pal, go to the Speedrun tab, set filters for your desired Eevee (Shiny, IVs, gender, Nature), and save.
3. Input the Current Seed in the 'Current Seed (Hex)' window and search for results.
4. Cycle between results using 'Next' and 'Previous.'
5. Once you find the right result, follow instructions to get the path and perform necessary advances.

## Method 2: Using the Shiny Eevee Spread List

This method needs Initial Seed RNG but quickly accesses great spreads.

1. Open PokeFinder, go to the Gamecube RTC tab, and input the Seed of your desired Eevee in the Target Seed section. Ensure the Initial Seed is around 15-20k advances, nothing earlier.
2. Do the Initial Seed RNG with RunAsDate, Dolphin, and the Lua script. Pause the emulator on the main screen.
3. Open PAL-Pal, go to the Custom Tab, and input your Current Seed.
4. For the Target Title Seed, input the Seed that allows hitting the target, not the Target Seed. Use the Researcher in PokeFinder, select XDRNG[R], put the Target Seed in the Seed box, set Max Advance to 1010, and generate results. Check Advance 1000; it's your Target Title Seed to input in PAL-Pal.
5. Click on Search; your Eevee should be first. Follow the path to advance your Seeds and get your shiny Eevee.

```
Note: The delay may not be exactly 1000 but slightly different. Stick with 1000; if it doesn't match the Target Seed, you'll perform a few extra advances in-game. To adjust, use results from Advance 1002 and 1004 in the Researcher.
```
