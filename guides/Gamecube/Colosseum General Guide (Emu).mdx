## Tools:

To RNG abuse Pokémon Colosseum, you will need:

1. PokeFinder
2. An ISO of Pokémon Colosseum
3. Dolphin version 4.0-6848 (this version works with RTC for Colosseum)
4. RunAsDate (x64)
5. A calculator

## Intro

This guide explains how to RNG Pokémon Colosseum using emulators. You need basic knowledge of Gamecube RNG (especially XD) and using Dolphin & VBA (Visual Boy Advance).

The original guide was provided by Jellal.

## Setting up

1. Open PokeFinder and select "Stationary" in the Gen 3 column.
2. Create a new profile for Pokémon Colosseum.
3. In the Gen 3 Stationary Window, select your new profile. PokeFinder will set Colo/XD as the search method.

## Configuration

Setting up Dolphin for this RNG is important, as we are using an outdated version with RTC only through RunAsDate.

1. In RunAsDate, select the path where your Dolphin.exe is located.
2. Choose "Absolute date/time" in Date/Time.
3. In "Parameters," type: `" -d "`.
4. Ensure other checkboxes are unchecked.
5. Set the date and time to 1/1/2000 at 12:00:00 AM.
6. Run Dolphin from RunAsDate.

In Dolphin, open your game, pause, and check Watch in View. Add these numbers to your RAM Watch:

For US Colosseum:

1. Main PRNG: 80478c90.
2. AI Slot 1: 80473070.
3. AI Slot 2: 804731a8.
4. AI Slot 3: 804732e0.
5. AI Slot 4: 80473418.
6. AI Slot 5: 80473550.
7. AI Slot 6: 80473688.

For PAL Colosseum:

1. Main PRNG: 804c6130.
2. AI Slot 1: 804c0508.
3. AI Slot 2: 804c0640.
4. AI Slot 3: 804c0778.
5. AI Slot 4: 804c08b0.
6. AI Slot 5: 804c09e8.
7. AI Slot 6: 804c0b20.

For JPN Colosseum:

1. Main PRNG: 80464360.
2. AI Slot 1: 8045e750.
3. AI Slot 2: 8045e888.
4. AI Slot 3: 8045e9c0.
5. AI Slot 4: 8045eaf8.
6. AI Slot 5: 8045ec30.
7. AI Slot 6: 8045ed68.

Click "Save," so you don't have to re-enter these values.

## The RNG Process

1. In the main PokeFinder window, go to Gen 3 Tools > IVs to PID.
2. Enter the IVs and Nature of your desired spread.
3. Copy the Seed from the results table.
4. Open the Gamecube RTC window (Gen 3 Tools). Enter the initial seed from 1/1/2000 and the seed from the IVs to PID window.
5. Set an advance range (e.g., 4000 min) and click "Search."
6. Gamecube RTC will provide the time you need to set up on RunAsDate to boot your game with the specific initial seed required.
7. Change RunAsDate's date and time values to match the ones from Gamecube RTC.
8. Boot up your game, ensuring the PRNG state in RAM Watch matches the seed in Gamecube RTC. If they don't match, check your Dolphin version, Date/Time, or PRNG value.
9. In PokeFinder's Gen 3 stationary window, enter your new initial seed, spread info, load your profile, and click "Calculate." Your target advance will be displayed.

## The RNG Process (Continued)

1. Boot your game and enter the overworld, starting from a point where you can reach your target Shadow Pokémon.
2. Create a save state before encountering the Pokémon.
3. To advance the PRNG:
   - In noiseless areas: Over 10,000 advances: Check a Shadow Pokémon's summary. Less than 3,000 advances: View a regular Pokémon's summary. Less than 500 advances: Go back and forth from the PDA Menu to Shadow Monitor.
   - In noisy areas (Bayleff method): Swap summaries of two non-shadow Pokémon.
   - During battles: Advance the RNG while battling.
4. In noiseless areas, you can control advancements. In noisy areas, PRNG advances uncontrollably. Hope to hit the correct PRNG state.
5. Advance the RNG using the techniques mentioned earlier. Make save states as you approach your target.
6. Once you are five advances from your target, trigger the encounter. Check the Shadow Pokémon's AI slot for your spread.
7. For confirmation, enter the PRNG address in Memory View.

From here, you can either KO the Pokémon and capture it later or capture it immediately. Once you're in the post-game, use Dive/Repeat/Luxury Balls from the mainline GBA games to capture your shiny Shadow Pokémon.

Congratulations! You now have a shiny Shadow Pokémon.
