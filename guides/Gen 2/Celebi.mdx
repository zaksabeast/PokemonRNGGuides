## Written guide

1. Save in front of the Celebi shrine. This lets you reset if needed.
2. Press `A` to interact with the shrine and stop when you see `Player put in the GS Ball.`
3. Open PokeReader to the RNG screen and wait until `Finding ADIV Index` and `Finding SDIV Index` are gone.
4. Pause PokeReader with `L + R` then enter the info from PokeReader into the RNG tool below. Press "Generate".
5. Unpause the game with `R` until near the target advance.
6. Pause then advance with `L` one at a time.
7. Stop when the "Advance" number in PokeReader matches one shown in the tool.
   - (Optional) Make a save state if you're on an emulator.
8. Press `A` to accept the Pokemon. **Do not press anything else until Celebi appears!**
9. If you got your Pokemon, congrats! If not, keep trying!

### Helpful tips

- This is unstable! Expect it to take many tries!
- Only use `L + R` to pause and advance in Gen 2, not `Start + Select`. `Start + Select` will mess up the RNG!
- Do not press any buttons in between pressing `A` and seeing Celebi.
  - Switching screens or pressing buttons during this time will mess up the RNG!
- The 3DS registers button presses instantly, but the Game Boy takes a few frames.
  - Pressing `A` too quickly might unpause the game without starting the encounter.
- Don't hold `A` too long. Press it slightly longer than one frame.
