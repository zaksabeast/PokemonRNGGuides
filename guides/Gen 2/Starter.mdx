## Written guide

1. Save in front of the starter you want, in case you need to reset the game.
2. Choose your starter and stop when you see the `Player received Pokemon` text with the flashing arrow to continue.
3. Go into PokeReader's RNG screen and wait until it stops saying `Finding ADIV Index` and `Finding SDIV Index`.
4. Pause PokeReader with `L + R`.
5. Type the information on PokeReader into the RNG Tool below and press "Generate".
6. Advance the game with `L` until PokeReader's `Advance` number matches one of the generated `Advance` columns below.
7. (Optional) Create a save state if you're on an emulator, in case you need to reset.
8. When you land on your desired advance, press `A` to accept the Pokemon.
9. If you got your Pokemon, congrats! If not, keep trying! It won't take long.

### Helpful tips:

- This is unstable! Expect it to take many tries!
- Only use `L + R` to pause and advance in Gen 2, not `Start + Select`. `Start + Select` will mess up the RNG!
- The gameboy takes more than one video frame to register a button press, but the 3ds notices it immediately. Pressing `A` too fast will unpause the game without starting the encounter.
- Holding `A` too long might mess up the RNG! Press it for more than one frame, but no longer.
