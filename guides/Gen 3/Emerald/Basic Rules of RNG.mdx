## RNG Methods

- For stationary Pokemon: Method 1.
- For wild encounters: Method H-2.

The different methods for wild encounters are caused by [vblank](/gba-vblank), though H-2 is the most commonly seen.

### Painting RNG

Painting RNG is a great method to obtain any desired initial seed. It's a more advanced technique and is covered in [this guide](/emerald-painting-rng).

## Speeding Up RNG Advances

### Battle Video

This method helps with seeding by preserving the RNG's state as an initial seed. Engage in a battle at the Battle Frontier and save it as a video. The video retains the seed from the battle, allowing you to set it as the initial seed when loading. For example, if your target is 1 million advances away, go up to 950k, save a battle video, and upon loading, you'll start at 950k advances.

While this method is helpful, it's a bit outdated compared to Painting RNG. However, it's useful when you need to hit a specific advance multiple times.

### In-Battle

Being in battle advances RNG twice as fast. This is particularly helpful for wild Pokemon RNG.
