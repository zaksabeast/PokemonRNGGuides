Gist: Catching the largest possible Lotad and Seedot to show to Sootopolis City brothers

## Sootopolis City Brothers

In Sootopolis City, two brothers are looking for the largest Lotad and Seedot. The reward for showing a Pokémon that exceeds the previous record is an Elixir (and the satisfaction of beating the record).

The size of a Pokémon depends on its PID and IVs. The largest size for Lotad and Seedot is 33.9in (86.2cm), which has approximately 1/32'000 chance to occur (much rarer than Shiny).

It is possible to use RNG manipulation to obtain the largest possible Pokémon.
