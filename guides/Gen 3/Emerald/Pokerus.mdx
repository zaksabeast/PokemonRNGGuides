<Gist>Gist: Be infected by Pokérus</Gist>

## Tools

- [mGBA](/mgba-setup)
- Download [Pokérus lua script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainingChain/pk_emu_scripts/refs/heads/main/Gen3/pokerus.lua)

## Pokérus

After each wild battle, there is a 1 / 21,845 chance that one of your Pokémon will be infected with Pokérus. While infected by Pokérus, EVs gained from battling are doubled. Pokérus is notably required to get optimal low-level Pokémon such as Level 5 Smeargle with Dragon Rage.

## Steps

1. <ShowIf slug="/emerald-pokerus-emu">Open mGBA.</ShowIf>
   <ShowIf slug="/rs-pokerus-emu">
     Open mGBA. Make sure that "Reatime clock" is disabled (Tools -> Game
     overrides...).
   </ShowIf>
1. Start your Pokémon game.
1. Load [pokerus.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainingChain/pk_emu_scripts/refs/heads/main/Gen3/pokerus.lua) script in mGBA (Tools -> Scripting... -> File -> Load script...).
1. Restart the game with "Ctrl+R".
1. Start a Pokémon battle and attack the wild Pokémon until it faints.
1. Make a savestate on the message "XXX gained YY EXP.Points.".
1. Pause the game with "Ctrl+P".
1. Write down the Current advance, which is displayed in the Scripting window.
1. Press `A` with the game paused, and while holding `A`, unpause the game with "Ctrl+P".
1. A message from the script will be displayed in the Scripting window.
1. A possible message is that the current battle can't be used to obtain Pokérus. In that case, end the battle and go back to Step 5.
1. The other possible message indicates by how many advances you were too late or too early to be infected by Pokérus.
1. Calculate the target advance you must press `A` by summing the Current advance wrote down on Step 8, and the additional advances indicated in the message of Step 12.
1. Reload your previous savestate (taken during the battle), and advance time with "Ctrl+N" until the Current advance matches the target advance calculated on Step 13.
1. Once they match, press `A` with the game paused, and while holding `A`, unpause the game with "Ctrl+P".
1. Check your Pokémon summary to verify it has the Pokérus marker.
