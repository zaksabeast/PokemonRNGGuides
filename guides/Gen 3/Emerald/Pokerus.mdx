<Gist>Gist: Be infected by Pokérus</Gist>

## Tools

- [mGBA](/mgba-setup)
- Download [Pokérus lua script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainingChain/pk_emu_scripts/refs/heads/main/Gen3/pokerus.lua)

## Pokérus

After each wild battle, there is a 1 / 21,845 chance that one of your Pokémon will be infected with Pokérus. While infected by Pokérus, EVs gained from battling are doubled. Pokérus is notably required to get optimal low-level Pokémon such as Level 5 Smeargle with Dragon Rage.

## Step 1 : Setup

1. <ShowIf slug="/emerald-pokerus-emu">Open mGBA.</ShowIf>
   <ShowIf slug="/rs-pokerus-emu">
     Open mGBA. Make sure that "Reatime clock" is disabled (Tools -> Game
     overrides...).
   </ShowIf>
1. Start your game and load the `pokerus.lua` script.
1. Restart the game with `Ctrl + R`.

## Step 2 : Calibration

1. Start a Pokémon battle and attack the wild Pokémon until it faints.
1. Make a savestate on the message "XXX gained YY EXP.Points.".
1. Pause the game with `Ctrl + P`.
1. Write down the Current advance, which is displayed in the Scripting window.
1. Press `A` with the game paused, and while holding `A`, unpause the game with `Ctrl + P`.
1. If the scripting window says the current battle can't yield Pokérus, end the battle and return to Step 1 of the calibration.
1. Otherwise, calculate your target advance by summing the current advance from Step 4 with the "Advance Difference" shown in the scripting window.

## Step 3: Hitting your target

1. Reload your previous savestate (taken during the battle), and advance time with `Ctrl + N` until the Current advance matches the target advance calculated in the last step.
1. Once they match, press `A` with the game paused, and while holding `A`, unpause the game with `Ctrl + P`.
1. Check the summary of all your Pokémon to verify if one of them has Pokérus.
