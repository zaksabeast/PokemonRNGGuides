## Intro

FRLG provides a helpful tool that's essential for any RNG work. It's one of the best tools you'll get when starting the game. However, vblank can be tricky. Follow these simple tips for a smoother RNG experience!

## RNG Methods

- For stationary Pokémon: Method 1.
- For wild encounters: Method H-1.

## Speeding Up RNG Advances

### Teachy TV

This item, obtained during the tutorial, can be a game-changer. Using it advances the RNG **313 times faster**, allowing you to hit targets millions of advances away in seconds. Get comfortable with it; it will be your ally.

### In-Battle

In any Gen 3 game, being in battle speeds up RNG advancement by a factor of two.

## Trainer Card Flip

In Gen 3, doing a Trainer Card Flip resets noise-related delays, helping you focus on the default delay. It's a crucial step to do almost automatically. Access your Trainer Card and press `A`. Do this between 10k-5k advances before your target advance. This can save you a lot of trouble.

## Minimizing Noise

To reduce vblank and noise issues, open your Trainer Card when starting your RNG, perform a flip, close it, and advance to your target advance. It sounds simple, but it's an effective strategy to protect yourself from unexpected surprises.
