You can refer to my FRLG guide for most of the content. This guide is BEFORE the update with Real's scripts.

This guide covers Fixed Initial Seed in Gen 3, specifically RS dry and Emerald.

---

## Tools

- [mGBA with lua scripts](/mgba-setup)
- [PokeFinder](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/PokeFinder/releases)

## Settings

### VBA-RR Setup

1. Set the save mode correctly.
2. Go to `Options > Emulation > Save Type > Automatic & Flash 128K`.
3. Disable Real Time Clock to obtain dead battery seeds.
4. Go to `Options > Emulation > Real Time Clock`.
5. Restart VBA if there are loading errors, like a corrupted save or dead battery message.
6. Load the Lua script.

### PokeFinder Setup

1. Launch PokeFinder and select Gen 3 Stationary.
2. Select a profile or input TID/SID information.
3. Input the correct initial seeds into PokeFinder:
   - "0" for Emerald.
   - "5A0" for Ruby/Sapphire.
4. Non-wild Pokémon for Generation 3 are Method 1.
5. Search for a spread and find a target frame.

## Hitting the Desired Frame

1. **Finding Delay**
   - Advance to the final screen before encountering the target Pokémon.
   - Make a save state ~100 frames before the encounter.

2. Press `A` when you land on your target frame to enter the encounter.
3. Use the period `.` key to advance by one frame when paused.
4. Take note of the IVs of the encountered Pokémon; they won't match the target Pokémon's IVs.
5. Open a new PokeFinder window and input the IVs of the encountered Pokémon.
6. To find the delay, subtract the frame hit from the desired frame.

`Delay = Frame Hit - Target Frame`

`Your new Target Frame = Desired Frame - Delay`

2. **Encountering the Pokémon**
   - Reload the previous save state before the encounter.
   - Advance to the new target frame.
   - If the Pokémon is not the desired one, find the new delay.
