<Gist>Gist: Be infected by Pokérus</Gist>

## Pokérus

After each wild battle, there is a 1 / 21,845 chance that one of your Pokémon will be infected with Pokérus. While infected by Pokérus, EVs gained from battling are doubled. Pokérus is notably required to get optimal low-level Pokémon such as Level 5 Smeargle with Dragon Rage.

## Step 1 : Setup

1. If you have entered the hall of fame and haven't had a [mass outbreak](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mass_outbreak#Generation_III), it is recommended to trigger one before attempting to RNG Pokérus. Alternatively, start a new game.
1. In your party, set a Pokémon leader knowing Sweet Scent (ex: Surskit) and 5 Pokémon with the ability Pickup (ex: Zigzagoon) holding no item.
1. Go on a grass patch on the farthest west side of Route 103 which has no wandering NPCs.
1. Save the game.
1. Fill the fields above the timer in the form below. Keep the Number of Pickup Pokémon to 5.

## Step 2 : Attempt getting Pokérus

1. Start the timer in the tool below.
1. When the 1st timer reaches 0, press `Start + Select + A + B` to reset the game.
1. Open the Pokémon menu, and wait with the option "Sweet Scent" selected.
1. When the 2nd timer reaches 0, press `A` to activate Sweet Scent and trigger a wild battle.
1. Defeat the wild Pokémon, and wait with the message "XXX gained YY EXP.Points." displayed.
1. When the 3rd timer reaches 0, press `A` to end the battle.

## Step 3 : Cabliration

1. Check all the Pokémon of your party if they now have Pokérus. If they do, congratulations!
1. If not and at least one of the Pickup Pokémon got an item, fill the form with the obtained items, and press "Generate".
1. Click on the "Update Calibration" button of the first row.
1. Attempt again to get Pokérus by following the Step 2.
