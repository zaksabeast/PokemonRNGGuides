This guide covers Fixed Initial Seed in Gen 3, specifically for RS dry and Emerald.

## Tools

- [mGBA with lua scripts](/mgba-setup)
- [PokeFinder](/pokefinder)

## Step 1: Set Up PokeFinder

Open PokeFinder with the correct profile and input the initial seed:

- `0` for Emerald.
- `5A0` for Ruby/Sapphire dry.

```
Note: To achieve dry Ruby/Sapphire, uncheck the real-time clock in VBA options.
```

## Step 2: Find Your Target

1. Find a target and go to the location.
2. Save your game.
3. In PokeFinder (Gen 3 => Wild), select the route and hit the criteria you want. For Ruby/Sapphire, use Method H-1; for Emerald, use Method H-2 (you can hit alternate spreads as well) once you've selected your target.

## Step 3: Calibrate

1. Launch VBA and create regular save states.
2. When close to your frame, do a calibration:
   - Save state.
   - Note the frame you're on.
   - Encounter a Pokémon using Sweet Scent.
   - Search that spread with PokeFinder.
   - Calculate the delay and enter it into the "delay box."
   - Regenerate your target to get your new frame.

## Step 4: Capture Your Pokémon

1. Go to your target frame to catch what you want.
2. If it doesn’t work, redo the calibration.
