RNG manipulation in Gen 3 lets you get the exact Trainer ID (TID) and Secret ID (SID) you want. This is useful for things like knowing your SID to RNG for shiny Pok√©mon. This guide covers how to do it on a physical console for Ruby and Sapphire.

This guide assumes you have a dead battery in your Ruby
& Sapphire cartridge. If you have a working battery, this method will not work.
