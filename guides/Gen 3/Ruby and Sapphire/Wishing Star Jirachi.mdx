## Intro

Wishing Star was an event distributed in 2003 whose distribution rom can be found on and extracted from the Colosseum bonus disc, making it an extra special type of RNG.

It's seeded with the current date and time and generated immediately, making it one of the easiest RNGs you will ever do.

Wishing Star has better spreads than Wishmaker and Meteor, but it cannot be shiny.

## The RNG

1. Find a target spread in the list below.
2. Configure RunAsDate to match the time and date of your target spread.
3. Launch VBA with RunAsDate, and load the multiboot rom.
4. Load your Ruby or Sapphire save in the emulator with "File" > "Import" > "Battery File".
5. Reset the game, and wait for the Jirachi to be distributed.
6. If Jirachi does not appear, retry the import and reset process.
7. VBA will create a new save file matching the ROM name.
   - Example: If the ROM is `sample0519.gba`, a new file `sample0519.sav` will be created.
8. Load your Ruby or Sapphire game and import the new battery file.
9. Reset the emulator and load your save to confirm Jirachi is in your party.
10. Save your game so the Jirachi is saved to your Ruby or Sapphire save.

Congrats! You have a Jirachi with the target spread.

## Troubleshooting

If your Jirachi has a PID of `15b6163b`, the RTC was not set.

Ensure you configured RunAsDate correctly.
