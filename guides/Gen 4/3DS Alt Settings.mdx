  Set 3DS system time without rebooting - useful for faster, more consistent
  Pokemon RNG attempts.

## What is 3DS Alt Settings?

[**3DS Alt Settings**](https://github.com/zaksabeast/Alt-3ds-Settings/releases/latest) is a homebrew app for the **Nintendo 3DS** that sets the 3DS system time using the same way as System Settings, but with a few improvements:

- Faster attempts since no reboot is needed.
- Resets milliseconds too, so you donâ€™t need to manually calibrate for time drift.

To use 3DS Alt Settings, your 3DS must have **Custom Firmware (CFW)** installed.

- [Here's a guide for installing Custom Firmware!](https://3ds.hacks.guide/)

## How do I use it?

It's pretty much the **exact same as NDS RNG**, but soft reset when the **first timer beeps**.

1. Download the [latest release of 3DS Alt Settings](https://github.com/zaksabeast/Alt-3ds-Settings/releases/latest).
2. When doing Gen 4/5 RNG on a 3DS, use the 3DS Alt Settings instead of the regular System Settings.
3. Set your 3DS date and time using the 3DS Alt Settings when you start your RNG timer.
4. Press `Start` to close the Alt Settings app.
5. Start your Gen 4/5 game.
6. When the first timer beeps, soft reset your game.
