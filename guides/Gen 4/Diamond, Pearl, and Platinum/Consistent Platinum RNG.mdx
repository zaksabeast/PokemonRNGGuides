Platinum RNG is notoriously inconsistent because the game seems to advance the RNG randomly.

New research has found a way to make it much more consistent!

## New Research

When the save loads, the game does a lot of extra RNG advances when the current time is after the last save date.

This mostly affects RNGing starters since you can't verify the current RNG state or reliably advance it.

## More consistent advances

To prevent these extra advances, set your console to the max date: 12/31/2099 on NDS or 12/31/2050 on 3DS before starting your RNG.

After that, you'll find that the game advances the RNG much more consistently, making it easier to hit your target.

This simple date tweak can save hours of frustration when RNGing Platinum starters.

## What next?

[RNG a starter in Platinum](/retail-dppt-starter) with this new knowledge!
