## Tools

- [PokeFinder](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/PokeFinder/releases)
- [Desmume](/desmume-setup)
- [RunAsDate](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_as_date.html)

##Step 1: Choosing your ID to hit

1. Go to the Gen 4 tab and select "ID's"

2. Under Filters, select TID and enter any 5-digit number you want

3. Choose a TID and SID combo that you like

4. Right click on chosen option and select "Generates time for seed"

```
Make sure your delay is at least 5000 frames, higher just gives you more time to hit your frame. You can go as low as 4000 for HGSS.
```

## Step 3: Setup RunAsDate

1. Launch RunAsDate.
2. Configure RunAsDate to match the image below.

![Setup](/images/Diamond-Pearl-Platinum/Initial-Seed/Setup.png)

```
You'll never have to change that after. This is the universal RunAsDate configuration for RNG (Gen 3, 4 or 5).
```

3. Select the program you want to fake the date/time with the `Browse...` button.
4. Set the date and time to hit your seed as shown in PokeFinder.
   - Right click on the chosen seed and choose "Generate times for seed".
5. Hit `Run` to launch Desmume.

## Step 4: Hit delay

1. Now that you have set up run as date and started your game, you now will want to quickly get through the opening sequence as fast as possible.
```
When naming your character, you will be changing your delay between even and odds if you use Capital letters or add symbols to your name.
```
2. Once you have gotten to this screen below, press CTRL + N and make a save state here. then slowly get to you target delay and hold A as you press CTRL + P

3. You will have most likely have not gotten the ID you were target. Enter the TID you did right in seed finder like below:

(picture of pokefinder tid box with id hit)

4. In this example, I hit 46 early. Go back to you save state and then hit your delay but adjust for the delay you experienced. (If you are early, you add the frame different. if you are late, you subtract)

5. Congrats! You should not have your target ID.

Understanding PID

Here's a basic overview to help with getting wanted PID.

1. Going up or down a year, will switch you between even and odd delays.
2. Consider the special tool for finding pairs faster if they're not found by PokeFinder search.

```
Remember to check for any updates on tools or methods.
```

Congrats! You've now got a better grasp on TID/SID RNG!
