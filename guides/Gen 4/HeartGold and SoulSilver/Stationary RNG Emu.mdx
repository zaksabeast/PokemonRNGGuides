## Intro

This guide lists Pokémon and highlights any unique features. The RNG process is consistent, and after reviewing the Initial Seed Guide and the Advancing guide, you'll have the basics down.

Make sure PokeFinder is open under Gen 4 => Static.

## Method K List

- Lapras.
- Electrode (\*3).
- Snorlax.

## Method 1 List

- Chikorita (initial advance of 1).
- Cyndaquil (initial advance of 5).
- Totodile (initial advance of 9).
- Kanto Starter (initial advance of 5).
- Hoenn Starter.
- Egg of Togepi.
- Eevee from Bill.
- Roamers.
- Game Corner.

```

To efficiently RNG the roamers, it's best to use the E4 Method. Encounter the roamer you want to RNG, defeat it, and then perform the RNG before battling Lance. Otherwise, you'll face an initial advance of 1 for Entei and 6 for Raikou. For Latios and Latias, RNG them right after leaving the fan club's door.
