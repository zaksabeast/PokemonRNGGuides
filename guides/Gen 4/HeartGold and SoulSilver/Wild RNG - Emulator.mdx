## Tools

You will need:

- Desmume (any version; 9.11 is more stable)
- Lua scripts (check Noob forums for this)
- PokeFinder
- A Sweet Scenter
- Optional: A lead

Before starting, you must know how to hit an initial seed. Refer to the appropriate guide for that.

## Step 1: Find Your Target

First, save in the area where you want to hunt.

1. Open PokeFinder, select Gen 4, then Wild.
2. Go to the Searcher tab (this step is important), select or create your profile.
3. Choose the route and enter your desired parameters. Since it's HGSS, remember to use method K, not method J.
4. Consider using leads to increase possible frames.
5. Be aware that the delay can be high, as well as the frames.

Once you have a target frame, right-click on it and select "Generate times for seed."

## Step 2: Setup the Emulator

1. Open your emulator and load your Lua script.
2. Hit the initial seed.
3. Open your menu with `X`.

From there, you can advance PIDRNG Frames in a few ways:

1. Use a Chatot (preferably x2) with chatter activated. If it doesnâ€™t work, use the record feature of Desmume to advance frames.
2. NPCs can advance frames randomly.
3. The radio (the bottom right one advances one by one, while Oak advances around 14-18 frames; the rest is more random).

Once you reach the right frame, just use your Sweet Scenter, and you're good to go!
