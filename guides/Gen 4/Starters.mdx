</Step>

<Step step={1}>

## Pick a starter

1. Fill out the tool below to find a starter that suits you.
2. If you can't find a starter you like, you can increase the min and max delays. This will increase the time to get the starter.

Shiny starters with high IV are unlikely to get in a reasonable amount of time. You'll have better chances aiming for a max of 3 perfect IVs.

## Prepare the save

1. If you're on Platinum, set your console date to **12/31/2099** on NDS or **12/31/2050** on 3DS.
1. Save at the location in the screenshots below depending on your game.

## Calibrate

1. Check your Pokemon stats.
2. If it matches your target, congratulations! You RNG'd your starter!
3. If not, type your Pokemon info into the form below and click "Generate".
4. Click "Calibrate" on the starter with the smallest delay offset (should be the first result).
5. Try to hit your target again.
6. If the "Flip Delay" column is checked for the Pokemon you hit, take one of these actions:
   - For **Any game**, insert a GBA cart
   - For **HeartGold and SoulSilver**, use the touch screen to press the down and up arrows on the continue screen.
   - For **Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum**, click "New Game", then press `B` to return to the continue screen.
   - If you've flipped the delay and are asked to flip it again, do not take any action.

In Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum it is possible for the delay to randomly switch from even to odd, or vice versa. When this happens, keep trying until you get the target.
