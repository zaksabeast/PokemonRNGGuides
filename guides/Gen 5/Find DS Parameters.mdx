## Tools

- [Desmume](https://www.pokemonrng.com/desmume-setup)
- [RNG Reporter](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/RNGReporter/releases)
- [RunAsDate](https://runasdate.en.softonic.com/)

## Things To Know

You need to find your DS Parameters to proceed with RNG. This only needs to be done once per save, console, or emulator.

## Step 1: Set Up RNG Reporter

1. Open RNG Reporter.
2. Click `5th Gen Tools -> Find DS Parameters`.
3. Choose your game version and language.
4. Set the Seed Encryption Variables:
   - DS Type: Lite/Original
   - DS MAC Address: `0009BF123456`
   - VCount: `10-70`
   - Timer0: `300-1200`
   - GxStat: `6-6`
   - VFrame: `0-15`
5. DeSmuMe's DS MAC Address is always `0009BF123456`.

```
Note: If you cannot find a seed, double-check your settings. If correct, try:
- VCount: `0-FF`
- Timer0: `0-FFFF`
This will take longer to search.
```

## Step 2: Find Your Seed

1. Open RunAsDate.
2. Enter any time and check `Immediate Mode`.
3. Input the same time in the DS Parameter Finder.

2. When you get a result, click `Send Results to Profile`.

Good luck with your RNG!
