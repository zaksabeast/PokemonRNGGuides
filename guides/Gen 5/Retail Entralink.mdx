## Tools

- [PokeFinder](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/PokeFinder/releases)
- [Rambo's RNG Reporter](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Bambo-Rambo/rngreporter/build/artifacts)
- [Mystic Timer](/mystic-timer)

## Understanding C-Gear RNG

C-Gear RNG in BW1 has three phases:

1. **Hitting Initial Seed** – Determines nature (PID).
2. **Hitting C-Gear Seed** – Determines IVs.
3. **Advancing to Target Nature** – Ensures correct nature using Initial Seed.

The **C-Gear Seed** is set upon entering **Entralink**, independent of the Initial Seed. It depends on:

- **Exact Date & Time** (down to the second).
- **Delay** (time elapsed in visual frames since game load; 30fps).

## Preparation

1. Have a **Pokémon in your Entree Forest** to RNG. Ideally, only **one** in the first Center Area to avoid unnecessary frame advancements.
2. _(Optional)_ Use **[Entralinked](https://github.com/kuroppoi/entralinked)** as a Game Sync emulator for Pokémon Black & White.
3. _(Optional but recommended)_ Gather **20-30 Rare Candies**. Most Entralink Pokémon are level 10, so these will help determine exact IVs. If low on Rare Candies, RNG manipulate Pickup in Gen 5 to farm them efficiently.
4. Be in a **location without moving NPCs**. Marvelous Bridge is recommended as it has no NPCs and low background noise, making Chatot verification easier.
5. Have at least **one Chatot** to verify RNG advances, as required for Gen 5 RNG.

## Step 1: Finding Your Target Seeds

### Finding the C-Gear Seed (Pokefinder C-Gear)

1. Open Pokefinder.
2. Open **Gen 5 Stationary**, go to **Searcher tab**.
3. Set parameters:
   - **Method:** IVs C-Gear.
   - **Min Delay:** 3000 | **Max Delay:** 12000 (or adjust as needed).
   - **Min Advances:** 15 | **Max Advances:** 20.
   - **IV Filters:** Set target IVs.
   - **Date Range:** Any year (20xx-01-01 to 20xx-12-31).
4. Press **Search**.
   - If no results, **increase Max Delay** or **broaden IV ranges**.

### Finding the Initial Seed (Entralink Seed Search)

1. Open **RNG Reporter**.
2. Copy your **BW1 profile data**.
3. Go to **5th Gen Tools > Entralink Seed Search**.
4. Paste your **C-Gear Seed**.
5. Set parameters:
   - **Year:** Match the C-Gear Seed's year.
   - **Max Advances:** 60.
   - **Target Nature:** Select desired nature.
6. Press **Search**.
   - If "invalid seed" error appears, try a different one from Pokefinder.
   - Ignore IVs showing as 0 (a display bug).
7. Pick a target **Initial Seed**:
   - On **DS/Lite/i**: Select one with **20-30 seconds**.
   - On **3DS/2DS**: Select one with **40-50 seconds**.

## Step 2: Setting Up Tools

### Adjacent Seed Tool (Verifying Initial Seed)

1. Open **5th Gen Tools > Adjacent Seed Tool**.
2. Select **BW1 profile**.
3. Set parameters:
   - **Method:** IVs (Standard Seed).
   - **Min & Max Frame:** 1.
   - **Seconds ±:** 1 (DS/Lite/i) or 3 (3DS/2DS).
   - **Date & Time:** From Entralink Seed Search.
4. Press **Generate**.
5. Compare **Chatot pitches** to confirm your Initial Seed.

### Seed to Time (For Hitting C-Gear Seed)

1. Open **Seed to Time**.
2. Paste **C-Gear Seed** into the **Seed field**.
3. Select **BW (C-Gear Seed)** option.
4. Set parameters:
   - **Year:** Match Initial Seed’s year.
   - **Seconds checkbox:** Unchecked.
   - **BW1 profile selected**.
5. Press **Generate** (top-right).
6. Scroll to your **C-Gear Seed’s target Date/Time** from Entralink Seed Search.
7. Adjust parameters:
   - **Delays:** ±100 (increase to ±300 if needed).
   - **Seconds ±:** 7.
   - **Frame Min:** 21 | **Frame Max:** 31.
8. Press **Generate (bottom-right)**.

```
IVRNG frame shifts occur every 128 steps, advancing by the number of Pokémon in your party.
```

## Step 3: Setting Up Mystic Timer

1. Open **[Mystic Timer](/mystic-timer)**, select the **Gen 5 tab**.
2. Choose **Mode: Entralink**.
3. Set calibration:
   - **DS/Lite/i**: ~-95.
   - **3DS/DSi**: ~-400 to -500.
4. Set **target delay** and **target seconds** from Seed to Time.
5. Set **Entralink Calibration** to 315 (adjust later if needed).
6. Ignore "Minutes before target: 1." Set time/date to match Adjacent Seed Tool.

## Step 4: Performing the RNG

### Phase 1: Hitting the Initial Seed

1. Set console date/time as shown in Adjacent Seed Tool.
2. Start **Mystic Timer**, then confirm time in console settings.
3. When the timer runs out, start the game **without pressing any buttons**.
4. Let the season screen fade on its own.
5. Use **5-10 Chatot calls** to verify the seed (check Adjacent Seed Tool for pitch comparison).
6. If on the wrong seed, check against adjacent seeds.

### Phase 2: Hitting the C-Gear Seed

1. **Activate C-Gear**, dismiss the pop-up, press `X > B` to skip loading.
2. Tap **Wireless > Entralink**, but **DO NOT press A or B yet**.
3. When the timer beeps, press `A` or `B` to enter Entralink.
4. Catch the Pokémon immediately and calculate **exact IVs**.

### Phase 3: Checking the Hit Seed

1. Open **Seed to Time**, use "Search IVs".
2. If no match, expand **delay range** to ±300 and retry.
3. If still no match, double-check time/date inputs.
4. If close to target delay, do **not** adjust yet.
5. If off by more than 5 delay, enter hit values in **Mystic Timer** and update.
6. **Calibration will adjust accordingly** (e.g., 0 → -90).

```
If results are inconsistent, widen search parameters slightly.
```

## Step 4: Advancing frames

1. Pay attention to the **IVRNG Frame**.
2. Subtract **13** from your target frame. You will advance frames until you hit that.
3. Advance frames by walking around. Only have 1 Pokémon in your party to avoid advancing too many frames at once.
4. When you hit your IVRNG Frame, interact with your target Pokémon immediately. Make a save state and enter the battle.
5. If done correctly, you will get the correct IVs on your target. Yay!
6. To get your Nature, move to Step 6 or reload the save state and re-catch the Pokémon.

Congrats! You've now got your Pokémon!
