## Advancing the Console Date

**3DS emulator (Azahar/Lime3DS/Citra):**

1. Open the "System" tab in the emulator settings.
2. Change "Clock" to "Fixed Time".
3. Change "Startup time" to your desired date.

**Physical console with time penalities removed:**

1. Follow our [guide to remove time penalties](/oras-remove-time-penalty).
2. Set your console date like normal.

```
Note: If you have problems with the above methods, start your game, save, then try again.
```

**Physical console without time penalities removed (untested):**

1. Set your console date to be the day before your target date.
2. Start the game and save.
3. Wait 24 hours, then play the game again.

## The RNG

1. Start the game and view PokeReader's "Mirage Spot" screen.
2. Enter the Mirage Spot seed, your TID, and console's save date into the RNG Tool below.
3. Press "Generate" to get the Mirage Spot's details, and choose a Mirage Spot you want to visit.
4. Turn off your game and set your console's date to the Mirage Spot's date.
5. Start the game and go to the Mirage Spot you chose. The Mirage Spot will update when you start to fly.
