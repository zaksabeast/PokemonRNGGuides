The game will lock time based events for 24 hours when any of these happen:

- A save is moved between consoles.
- A cartridge was saved on one console, then played on another.
- A save is copied from a physical console to an emulator.
- A physical console's time is adjusted (emulator is fine).

Adjusting time on emulators is fine because it acts as if real world time has passed, not as if you're changing console settings.

## Emulators (Citra, Lime3DS, Azahar)

1. Set your emulator date to be earlier than your desired date.
2. Start the game and save.

That's it! You can now set the date to any future date without penalty.

## Physical Consoles

1. Update your Pokemon Game to the latest version.
2. Set your console date to be earlier than your desired date.
3. Start the game, save, then close the game.
4. Enable IPS patching with [our patch guide](/misc-3ds-ips-luma-citra).
5. Create a Luma patch folder if it doesn't exist:
   - Omega Ruby: `/luma/titles/000400000011C400/`
   - Alpha Sapphire: `/luma/titles/000400000011C500/`
6. Download the `code.ips` for your specific game and copy it to the patch folder
   - [Omega Ruby code.ips](/downloads/or-remove-time-penalty/code.ips)
   - [Alpha Sapphire code.ips](/downloads/as-remove-time-penalty/code.ips)

If you run into any issues in the future, remove the patch and follow those steps again.
