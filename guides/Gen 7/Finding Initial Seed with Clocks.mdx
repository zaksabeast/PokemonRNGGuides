## Tools

- Video camera (your phone's camera should work)
- [3DSRNGTool](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/3DSRNGTool/releases)

## General principle

Each time you boot your game, an `initial seed` (also called `seed`) is created. This seed is used to RNG abuse wild encounters, events, in-game gifts, etc.

At the "Continue" screen of the game, before your character picture loads, you can see a clock. By checking the clock needle's position, we can find the initial seed. You need to check between 8 and 10 clocks without restarting the game. You can leave the "Continue" screen by pressing `B`.

## Step 1: Setup 3DSRNGTool

1. Open the 3DSRNGTool you downloaded.
2. Select your game version in the top right ("Sun", "Moon", "Ultra Sun", or "Ultra Moon").
3. Go to "Tools" > "Gen 7 Main RNG Tool".

4. Ensure the `InputBox` has `End Position` selected with the number `4`.
5. Also select the `Find Initial Seed via clock hands` option.

## Step 2: Recording the clock needles

1. Boot your 3DS and open the game. Leave it on the "Press Start" screen.
   - You can let the animations play; they do not affect the seed or frames.
2. Start recording your 3DS with your camera.
3. Press `A` or `Start` to go to the "Continue" screen.
   - Record the entire clock movement: from when you enter the "Continue" screen until your character picture displays.
4. Press `B` to return to the "Press Start" screen.
5. Alternate between the "Press Start" and "Continue" screens until you have 10 clock movements.

## Step 3: Finding the seed

After recording 10 clock movements, list them in the tool to find the initial seed.

1. In the `InputBox`, select the clock that matches the final position of each clock.
   - This End Position occurs just before the picture loads.
   - The End Position in the gif shown at the beginning is the last option in the Gen7 Main RNG Tool.
   - You should see a number appear in the `Needle List` (12 for the gif demo).
2. The tool tries to find your seed after you input 8 needle positions.

- You may get various results with only 8 needles; this is why we checked 10 clocks. Add the remaining 2 until you see a single seed.
  - The last 2 needle positions confirm your seed.
- If you don't get any results, check your video again to find mistakes in the needle positions.
- If you still can't find results, restart the game and record 10 new clocks.

Your seed should appear in the `Results` field if you did everything correctly.
