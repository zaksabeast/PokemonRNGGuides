```
Note: You can get the "honey" item in any store after clearing three trials.
```

## Step 1: Setup 3DSRNGTool

1. Type the `Init Seed` from PokeReader into the `Seed` box.
2. Enter your game version and TSV.
3. If you have the shiny charm, check the `Shiny Charm` box.
4. Click the `Wild RNG` tab and change the `Category` dropdown to `Island Scan`.
5. Change the `Pokemon` dropdown to your target Pokémon.

## Step 2: Create a timeline

1. Follow the [timeline guide](/retail-usum-timeline) using the `NPC count` from PokeReader.
2. You should have a target frame to hit.

## Step 3: The RNG

If you've followed the guide, you should now:

- Have made a timeline.
- Have a target frame.
- Be standing in the area to catch your Island Scan Pokémon.
- Have the `honey` item.

```
Note: If any of these are not true, start the guide over. Moving your character will mess up the RNG.
```

### Step 4: Hitting your target frame

1. Press `X` to open the in-game menu.
2. Hold the cursor on the `bag` option.
3. Watch the `Advances` counter on PokeReader.
   - When the `Advances` counter is close to your target frame, press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
   - Press `Select` multiple times to slowly advance frames to your target frame.
4. Once at your target frame, press and hold `A` to unpause the game while entering the bag.
5. Find and use the `honey` item to start a wild encounter.
6. If the Pokémon you encountered was not the Island Scan Pokémon, see how many frames off you were and adjust.
   - Search all frames for the IVs of the Pokémon you got. Check the frame range instead of the timeline and search using the IVs.
   - After finding your actual frame, adjust as necessary from the delay and restart from the beginning.
   - This should not happen frequently.
