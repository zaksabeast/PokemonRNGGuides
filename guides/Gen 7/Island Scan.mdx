```
Note: You can get the "honey" item in any store after clearing three trials.
```

## Step 1: Setup PCalc

Make sure PCalc's wild view and game view are open.

```
Note: In PCalc, press `Start + Left` to open the wild view and `Start + Up` to open the game view.
```

## Step 2: Setup 3DSRNGTool

Open 3DSRNGTool and set it up:

### In the upper right of 3DSRNGTool

1. Type the `Init Seed` from PCalc into the `Seed` box.
2. Change the `Game Version` dropdown to your game.
3. Change `TSV` to your game's TSV.
4. If you have the shiny charm, check the `Shiny Charm` box.

```
Note: Find your TSV in PCalc's Game Info window. Press `Start + Up` to bring up the menu if needed. The TSV is labeled "YOUR TSV".
```

### On the left of 3DSRNGTool

1. Click the `Wild RNG` tab.
2. Change the `Category` dropdown to `Island Scan`.
3. Change the `Pokemon` dropdown to your target Pokémon.

### On the right of 3DSRNGTool

1. Follow the [timeline guide](/retail-usum-timeline) using the `NPC Count` from PCalc. Wait at least 30 seconds after opening the window to allow the NPC counter to calibrate.
2. You should have a target frame to hit.

### In the middle of 3DSRNGTool

1. Change the IVs to your desired values for the Pokémon.
2. If you want a shiny Pokémon, check the `Shiny Only` box.

```
Note: If you don't care about IVs, leave the ranges as 0-31.
```

## Step 3: The RNG

If you've followed the guide, you should now:

- Have made a timeline.
- Have a target frame.
- Be standing in the area to catch your Island Scan Pokémon.
- Have the `honey` item.

```
Note: If any of these are not true, start the guide over. Moving your character will mess up the RNG.
```

### Hitting your target frame

1. Press `X` to open the in-game menu.
2. Hold the cursor on the `bag` option.
3. Watch the `Frame` counter on PCalc.
   - When the `Frame` counter is close to your target frame, press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
   - Press `Select` multiple times to slowly advance frames to your target frame.
4. Once at your target frame, press and hold `A` to unpause the game while entering the bag.
5. Find and use the `honey` item to start a wild encounter.
6. If the Pokémon you encountered was not the Island Scan Pokémon, see how many frames off you were and adjust.
   - Search all frames for the IVs of the Pokémon you got. Check the frame range instead of the timeline and search using the IVs.
   - After finding your actual frame, adjust as necessary from the delay and restart from the beginning.
   - This should not happen frequently.

```
Note: If you paused the game too early, press `Start` to unpause the game.
```
