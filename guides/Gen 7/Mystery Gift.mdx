## Tools

- A 3DS with PCalc ([PCalc Install Guide](/misc-3ds-installing-pcalc))
- [3DSRNGTool](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/3DSRNGTool/releases)

Before starting, go to the first PokeCenter (by the Pokémon School) and stand in front of the Delivery Man.

## Step 1: Start at the final screen

Stand exactly as shown in the image below, or the timeline may be incorrect, causing you to miss your target frame.

You should see the text: "You received xxx!"

## Step 2: Set Up 3DSRNGTool

1. Input your game version and TSV in the upper right.
   - Use PCalc by pressing `Start + Up` to view the Game View window. Your TSV is shown after `YOUR TSV`.
2. Input the initial seed in the upper right.
   - Find this by pressing `Start + Up` in the Game View window, where it says `Init Seed:`.
3. Check the Shiny Charm box if you have it.
4. Ensure you're on the "Event RNG" tab in 3DSRNGTool.
5. If you have the WonderCard file (.wc7) for the event, import it into 3DSRNGTool to update "Event Setting" automatically.
   - WonderCard files are available [here](https://github.com/projectpokemon/EventsGallery).
   - Alternatively, you can enter the data manually, but ensure it's correct for your event.

```
Note: Some events trigger a Pokedex registration animation, affecting RNG by changing the delay from 0 to 62 frames. Check 'No Dex Entry' in RNG Info to calibrate correctly. When the Pokedex entry screen comes up, try to close it quickly.
```

## Step 3: RNGing the Pokémon

1. Create a timeline using this guide: [Gen 7 Timeline Guide](/retail-usum-timeline).
2. Advance to your target frame. When you land on it, press `A` to unpause and obtain the Pokémon.

Congrats! You should now have the Pokémon you wanted. If not, reset the game and try again.

```
Note: View the Pokémon's info using PCalc. Press `Start + Right` for Party View. Use `Select + Right` to cycle through party members in Party View.
```

## Additional notes

If you didn't get the Pokémon you wanted:

1. Double-check all information, especially the initial seed.
2. Restart the guide from the beginning and follow _all_ instructions. Incorrect Pokémon usually result from user error.
3. Ensure you're creating a timeline correctly. Skipping a target frame often comes from not doing it right.
