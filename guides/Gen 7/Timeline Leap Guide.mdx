This guide uses **Frame 1** and **Frame 2** to refer to two key points in the RNG timeline:

- **Frame 1**: The frame where you'll press `A` to initiate an action (e.g., advance dialogue) and jump to your desired timeline.
- **Frame 2**: The target frame in your desired timeline, which determines the Pokémon you receive.

The goal is to use Timeline Leap to land on Frame 1 at the right moment, which will then jump you to the timeline of Frame 2 (your Pokémon's timeline).

Possible ways to leap:

1. **Dialogue**: The game makes 1 RNG call while loading the next line of text.
2. **Closing the X menu**: The game makes 2 RNG calls for the next character fidgets.
3. **Press `A` on the Yes/No screen (Mystery Gifts)**: The game makes about 10 RNG calls to generate the Pokémon.

```
Note: Timeline leap is not available for wild Pokemon since there is not a way to jump between timelines when using Honey.

## Tools

- [A 3DS with PokeReader](/install-pokereader)
- [3DSRNGTool](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/3DSRNGTool/releases)

## Step 1: Select your target frame

1. Go to "Filters" and search for your desired Pokemon. Leave "Safe F Only" unchecked.
2. Search using "Frame Range" to find a frame you want to land on.
3. Right-click on it to "Set as Target Frame". This frame will be referred to as "Frame 2" from here on.

## Step 2: Advance frames

Use Festival Plaza or Hau'Oli shopping mall to advance frames quickly.

## Step 3: Position your character

As you near Frame 2, exit Festival Plaza or fly to where you will battle or receive the Pokemon.

- If it's Xurkitree, stand behind it for a wider window of 1 NPC.
- If it's a Mystery Gift, go to the first PokeCenter, and stand behind the delivery man looking at the red counter. Ensure there are 4 NPCs. If there are 5 NPCs, leave and re-enter the PokeCenter.

## Step 4: Reach the leap screen

Navigate to the final `A` press screen that will trigger the battle or reception of your Pokemon.

- For Mystery Gifts, engage the delivery man to the Yes/No dialogue.
- If it's Xurkitree, open the menu when the NPC counter in PokeReader switches from 2 to 1. This will pause NPCs.
- For in-game gifts and stationaries, the final dialogue will advance 1 frame.

## Step 5: Stop at any safe frame

Use 3DSRNGTool to find safe frames with the "Safe F Only" filter. Reset filters before looking up a safe frame.

## Step 6: Find the timeline leap frame

1. Once you confirm your frame is safe, input it as the starting frame in the "Frame Range."
2. Choose "Timeline Leap" and click "Calculate."
3. A window will pop up with the frame to press `A` on. This is Frame 1.
   - For Mystery Gifts, this is when you press `A` on "Yes" to accept the Pokémon.
   - For the menu method, this is the frame to close the menu.
   - For other Pokémon, it’s the 3rd or 4th press of `A` before the final screen.

## Step 7: Verify the target frame

Because 3DSRNGTool’s "Frame Range" mode may not always match perfectly, check that Frame 2 still has the spread you want before continuing.

1. In the pop-up window, choosing "Yes" will confirm if Frame 2 still has the spread you want.
   - Choosing "No" lets you check for other Frame 1 options that might land you on the right spread in Frame 2.
2. If Frame 2 doesn’t have the spread you want, search for your target spread in the timeline (click "Yes" when the window appears).
   - Right-click and select "Set as Target Frame" on the desired spread. This becomes your new Frame 2.
3. If Frame 2 isn't in the timeline, find the new frame with the spread by selecting "Frame Range." Then, redo the "Timeline Leap" to find the new Frame 1.

## Step 8: Profit

1. Advance to Frame 1 and press `A` to move the dialogue to the final screen.
   - For the menu method, hold `X` and press `A` to unpause and close the menu, then immediately press `Start + Select` to pause the game again.
2. Be ready to press `A` on Frame 2, as there's a small 1-10 second interval between frames.
3. Press `A` or take a step forward on Frame 2 to receive your Pokémon. Congratulations!
