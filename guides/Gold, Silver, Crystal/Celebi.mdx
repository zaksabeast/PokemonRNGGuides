## Tools

- [PokeReader](/install-pokereader)

## Written guide

1. Save in front of the Celebi shrine, in case you need to reset the game.
1. Press "A" to interact with the shrine and stop when you see `Player put in the GS Ball.`.
1. Go into PokeReader's RNG screen and wait until it stops saying `Finding ADIV Index` and `Finding SDIV Index`.
1. Pause PokeReader with `L + R`.
1. Type the information on PokeReader into the RNG Tool below and press `Generate`.
1. Advance the game with `L` until PokeReader's `Advance` number matches one of the generated `Advance` columns below.
1. (Optional) Create a save state if you're on an emulator, in case you need to reset.
1. When you land on your desired advance, press `A` to accept the Pokemon. **Do not press anything else until you see Celebi!**
1. If you got your Pokemon, congrats! If not, keep trying!
