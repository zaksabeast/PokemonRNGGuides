Well here it's just throwing everything you know. Since it's late I might forget some so I just give ideas :
Chatot / Radio / Walking etc you get the idea ?

## Chatot Chatter

The move Chatter can be used to advance the RNG by one. This is done by first recording audio for Chatter, then viewing the summary screen for Chatot in your party. Each time the Chatter sound is played, the RNG advances by one.

## Radio

Not sure how this works? Need more info.

## Walking

Need more info for this as well. When is this viable over Chatot?

Nothing else, nothing special. It's always good to know all the methods here, even if this guide is rather short.

Now that we know everything, it's time to start for a RNG. Here you'll explain what you can do (going for Wild, a TID / SID for a starter etc)
