Well here it's just throwing everything you know. Since it's late I might forget some so I just give ideas :
Chatot / Radio / Walking etc you get the idea ?

## Chatot Chatter

The move Chatter can be used to advance the RNG by one. This is done by first recording audio for Chatter, then viewing the summary screen for Chatot in your party. Each time the Chatter sound is played, the RNG advances by one.

## Radio

Switching channels advances the RNG. Oak's channel advances between 14-18, other channel 0-1. Helps for larger advances for both emulator and retail.

## Walking

Need more info for this as well. When is this viable over Chatot?

Advances RNG by how many Pokemon in party every 128 steps. Useful when there isn't Chatot available. More difficult on retail because of step number.

Nothing else, nothing special. It's always good to know all the methods here, even if this guide is rather short.

Now that we know everything, it's time to start for a RNG. Here you'll explain what you can do (going for Wild, a TID / SID for a starter etc)
