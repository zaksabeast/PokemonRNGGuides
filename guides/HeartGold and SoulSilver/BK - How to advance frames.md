Well here it's just throwing everything you know. Since it's late I might forget some so I just give ideas :
Chatot / Radio / Walking etc you get the idea ?

## Chatot Chatter

- For this method you must have a Chatot with the move Chatter and you must have recorded a custom Chatter to advance PIDRNG frames with this method. Afterwards, accessing Chatot's summary page will advance the PDIRNG frame by 1.
- You do not have to listen to the whole Chatter sound, simply viewing their summary is enough.
- To make things quicker you can have two Chatots next to each other in your party and flip between their summaries by pressing `Up` and `Down`.

## Radio

Switching channels advances the RNG. Oak's channel advances between 14-18, other channel 0-1. Helps for larger advances for both emulator and retail.

Can be combined with other ways of advancing the RNG for more precision when near target advance.

## Character Movement

- Taking a step or turning in areas where you can encounter wild Pokemon (grass, water, or caves) advances the PIDRNG frame by 1 for each step or turn made.
- Walking at least 128 steps will advance the PIDRNG frame by the number of Pokemon in your party
- There is an internal step counter that starts at 0 and increases up to 128 before resetting back to 0. The step counter is always saved, therefore if you load your game and the step counter is at 127, taking one step will advance the PIDRNG frame by the number of Pokemon in your party.
- It is recommended to not use this method unless none of the other methods are an option.

## NPC Movement

- Any NPC that randomly moves, by either turning or walking, will advance the PIDRNG frame by 1 for each random movement. If an NPC does both, then the PIDRNG frame advances by 2.
- NPCs offscreen can still advance the PIDRNG frame as long as they are within the same area. Because of this, it is advised to attempt your captures in areas with little or no NPCs.
- You can stop some NPCs from randomly moving by using the VS Seeker.
- If NPC movement cannot be avoided you must press `X` to bring up the menu the moment you enter the ingame world. This freezes all NPCs in place and stops them from making any unnecessary advancements.

## Active Roamer

- Having an active roamer in your game advances the initial PIDRNG frame by a different value depending on the seed.
- PokeFinder will account for this(?)

Nothing else, nothing special. It's always good to know all the methods here, even if this guide is rather short.

Now that we know everything, it's time to start for a RNG. Here you'll explain what you can do (going for Wild, a TID / SID for a starter etc)
