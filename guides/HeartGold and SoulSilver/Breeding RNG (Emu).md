What you need :

- RNG Reporter (since i didn't try with Finder atm)
- Desmume
- Lua Script (noob link atm)

Setup :

/!\ Avoid items on parents /!\

Just need to put the parents on the daycare => knowing their ivs and save.

PID PART :

Open 4th gen time finder => Shiny Egg

Enter all the data you need. International parents = masuda.
Min delay : 600. Max delay : up to you.
Generate a list.

/!\
It's easier to take a Frame 1 here. Since the advancement is not the same. If you take a HIGHER Shiny Egg Frame, you have to know that there's only two way to advance it :

- Calling Joey ups it by 2
- Discarding an egg ups it by 1
  /!\

Once you choose your target frame, just hit your frame (link to hitting a initial frame), once done enter in the game and move until the egg is ready to be generated.
Once done, just save your game.

Note : If you want to be sure, you can create a save state, take the egg, verify it via pkhex, and reload the state.

IVs PART :

This one is more classic.

In 4th gen time finder => IVs Egg

Put your parents IVs :
Parent A is the first parent you deposited
Parent B is the second parent you deposited

Put the ivs wanted, the delay / frame range you want.
Once done, generate a list. Select your target frame.
Right click for Generate Times

Hit your initial seed, advance the frames in the basic way (chatot, radio, npc advancing if you like risky things) and take your frame

done
