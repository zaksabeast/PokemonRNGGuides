Introduction : This guide will be a simple summary of the advantages of Cute Charm in Gen 4, how to execute it and how to RNG with it. This guide will assume you're used with a lot of knowledge with Gen 4 RNG, including how to hit an initial seed, how to do a TID / SID RNG.
```

## Requirements

- PokeFinder
- All the tools necessary to RNG Abuse with DesMuMe
- Knowing which PID / Group you'll want to hit (It'll be explained right after)
- Once everything done, a Cute Charm Lead.

## PID ? Groups ?

```
Note : It doesn't work on Method 1 Pokémon. It can work on gendered ratios Legendary. It doesn't work on ANY Genderless or 100% Male / Female Pokémon
```

So the idea of this guide is to focus on the RNG process itself and not to spend too much on how / why this glitch does exists. So for a simple summary, by RNGing a specific TID / SID combo to make some PID to be Shiny, using Cute Charm will allow them to be more than present, and that way being able to hit amazing spreads. This can be used for either Shiny Hunting or for RNGing. 

But the important concept is about PID Groups and Leads. It's not possible to RNG a combinaison of TID / SID and then having all the possible Cute Charm PID being Shiny. Some choices have to be done : Based on the Gender of your target (and then in some case the Gender Ratio) and the nature, you'll want to hit a totally different PID Group. So for that, you'll have to keep in your head a target. 

If you want a Shiny Female, then you don't have to worry, only the nature will matter. If you want a Shiny Male, however, you'll need to search the right Gender Ratio (example : Bulbasaur is 82.5 / 17.5) and then the right nature in order to find the correct PID to go for. Here're the tables with all the PID for each case :

### Male Lead (Target : Shiny Female, Gender Ratio is ignored)

```
Example : I want a Shiny Male Adamant Machop. Machop is 75% Male, so I'll look at the 3rd table. Inside the PID Group 1, I can find the matching PID : 0000004E. So I'll RNG a TID / SID around this group.
```

* Then open PokeFinder and Pandora's Box. Input all the necessary informations with the correct PID.
* RNG the TID / SID on a fresh save.
* Progress enough to get a cute charm / get one as early as possible
* Go to an area with a Machop and search for a Shiny. It's important to search with the Cute Charm lead on PokeFinder !
* RNG it.

```
Note : It can be used to Shiny Hunt in general and RNGing a TID / SID for a PID will work for the group. But don't forget if you want to use that for Shiny Hunting, Gender Ratio is important in the case of a Female Cute Charm Lead.
