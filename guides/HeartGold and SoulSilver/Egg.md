## Requirements

- PokeFinder
- All the tools necessary to RNG Abuse with DesMuMe
- Access to the Daycare and the informations about your parents.

## Intro

In this guide, we'll show you how to advance the RNG to get the Pokémon you want. This guide assumes you already know some basics about Gen 4 RNG, like how to start things off and advance the RNG.

The Masuda Method was introduced in this generation, but it's not super important to use it.

## Setup

Getting things ready is not too hard:

1. Open PokeFinder and go to Gen 4 => Eggs => Searcher.
1. Choose your profile and type in your parents' info. The Pokémon that went into the daycare first is Parent A, and the other is Parent B.
1. Drop off your parents at the daycare and save your game.

## Hitting the PID using Egg Advances

Aim for an egg that does need need to advance the RNG. It's the easiest way to go:

1. In PokeFinder, set your Advance Range to 0-0.
1. Choose the specific traits you want for your Pokémon, like Shininess, Nature, Gender, Ability, and so on.
1. Generate the results based on your criteria.
1. Select your target RNG advance.
1. RNG your Initial Seed.

If for some reason you're advancing the RNG beyond 0, you'll need to bump up the egg advance before making your egg. Here are a few ways to do it:

- Use the Magikarp Coin to advance the RNG by 1.
- Fire up the Happiness App (whether it's loaded or used) – it advances the RNG 2 times the number of Pokémon on your team.
- Calling Youngster Joey (available Route 30) advances the RNG by 2.

Don't forget to save your game in front of the old man.

## Hitting the IVs

The second part of the RNG is more standard. Switch over to the 'IVs' Method on PokeFinder and set your IV filters. Take into account the IVs from your parents, but keep in mind that getting some 31 IVs is not too hard.

Get a result, hit your target advance, and advance the RNG like any other RNG.

Once you've done all this right, grab your egg, and it'll be your desired Pokémon.
