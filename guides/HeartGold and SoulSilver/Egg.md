Introduction : In this guide, we'll see how to advance the Egg Frame, which is used for PID, and then how to get the desired IV Spread. As always, this guide will assume that the basics of Gen 4 RNG are known. How to hit an initial Seed, how to advances frames etc.
```

## Requirements

- PokeFinder
- All the tools necessary to RNG Abuse with DesMuMe
- Access to the Daycare and the informations about your parents.

```
Note : Masuda has been introduced with this generation. It's supported and will not be an issue. Is it important to use it ? Not really.
```

## Setup 

Only a few steps here :
* Open PokeFinder, Gen 4 => Eggs => Searcher. Select your profile, input the infos of your parents. **Parent A and B means in what order you've put them in the daycare, so take note of the order**
* Put the parents in the daycare and save the game


## Hitting the PID using Egg Frames

So the introduction will be simple : **Based on how easy is it to find target frames, it's always suggested to search for a Egg Frame = 0**. So in PokeFinder, you'd just search for 0 - 0 in Advance Range, input your filters for PID (Shininess, Nature, Gender, Ability etc. Nothing related to IVs pretty much), generate results and select a target one. Then it'll just be about hitting an Initial Seed which is something you have already the knowledge of. 

Be sure you hit the right initial seed, generate an egg. Congratulations, you did the PID part.

However, if for some reason, you went for a target where the advances is not equal to 0, you'll need to advance the Egg Frame before generating the egg. Here's a list of method in how to do it : 
* Using the Magikarp Coin advances by 1
* Calling Youngster Joey (available Route 30) : 2

Just advances using this and then generate an egg. Save in front of the old man.


## Hitting the IVs

The second part is more classic. Swap to the Method 'IVs' on PokeFinder. Then input search Filters for IVs. Take care of the Inheritance of your parents for the IVs but don't forget that it'll be not difficult to hit multiple 31 IVs. 

You just have to generate a result, hit a target frame and then advance the frames like any basic RNG. The noise there is not the worse, and you shouldn't have too much trouble to hit them.

Once you've done it right, just pickup your egg. It'll have everything desired.
