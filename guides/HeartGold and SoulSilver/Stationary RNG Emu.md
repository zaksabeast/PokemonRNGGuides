Introduction : In this guide, the idea is more to give a list of Pokemon, is there anything special about these. The RNG itself is always the same and by reading the Initial Seed Guide AND the Advancing guide, the basics are set.

## Requirements

- PokeFinder (Gen 4 => 'Static')
- Be in front of your target
- All the tools necessary to RNG Abuse with DesMuMe

## Method K List

## Method 1 List 
* Johto Starter (/!\ Starting Frames) : Chikorita 1, Cyndaquil 5, Totodile 9
* Kanto Starter (/!\ Starting Frames) : All at 5
* Hoenn Starter
* Egg of Togepi
* Eevee from Bill
* Roamers (/!\ Starting Frames) : It's suggested to do the E4 Method for these. It means to encounter the one you want to RNG, defeat it and then do the RNG before facing Lance. Otherwise, Entei has a starting frame of 1 and Raikou of 6. For Lati@s you would RNG them once leaving the fanclub's door.
