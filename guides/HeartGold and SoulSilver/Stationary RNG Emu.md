## Requirements

- PokeFinder

- All the tools necessary to RNG Abuse with DesMuMe

## Intro

In this guide, our focus is to provide a list of Pokémon and point out any unique characteristics they may have. The RNG process remains constant, and once you've reviewed both the Initial Seed Guide and the Advancing guide, you'll have the fundamentals in place.

Please make sure that PokeFinder is opened under Gen 4 => Static.

## Method K List

## Method 1 List

- Chikorita (initial advance of 1)
- Cyndaquil (initial advance of 5)
- Totodile (initial advance of 9)
- Kanto Starter (initial advance of 5)

Note: To efficiently RNG the roamers, it's recommended to use the E4 Method. This involves encountering the roamer you wish to RNG, defeating it, and then performing the RNG before battling Lance. If not, you'll be dealing with an initial advance of 1 for Entei and 6 for Raikou. As for Latios and Latias, you should RNG them immediately after exiting the fan club's door.
