A fast sentence on HOW to. The idea is to say. Now you know how to hit your initial seed / your frame, the idea of this guide is more to learn how these stationary works or if there's any special case more than working on the 'HOW to part'.

Explaining anyway how to make the difference between both.

Going for cases like Starters, Leg eggs, how to do Roamers etc. The idea is REALLY to give user's tip on the methods rather than going for the how to
