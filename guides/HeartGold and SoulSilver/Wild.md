Same as for stationary, the intro would be the how to RNG it but would be only a few line since the user MUST have the Basic Knowledge. Maybe a reminder to read this if they don't know.

Going for details on wild. Maybe adding the tables in case.

Explaining leads
Explaining Fishing
Explaining Rock Smash
Explaining Bug Contest / Safari Zone (1IVs rule)

Explaining Sweet Scent Less ?
