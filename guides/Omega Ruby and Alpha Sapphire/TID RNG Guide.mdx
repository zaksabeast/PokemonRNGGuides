```
If a save file is present, delete it by pressing `X+Y+Down` on the d-pad at the title screen. This will remove the save file and start the game at the language select screen.
```

## Tools

- A 3DS with PCalc ([PCalc Install Guide](https://www.pokemonrng.com/misc-3ds-installing-pcalc))
- [3DSRNGTool](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/3DSRNGTool/releases)
- (Optional) A network connection

## Step 1: Setup 3DSRNGTool

1. In the upper right corner, select your game version and click "Advance."
   - Seed and TSV can be blank.
2. In the ID tab, fill in your desired TID, SID, or TSV.
3. 3DSRNGTool can search for multiple numbers partially or fully.
   - Finding a specific TID/SID/TSV combination is very rare. It is advised to RNG for only one at a time.

In this example, we will be getting the highlighted TID.

## Step 2: Setup the game

1. Load BootNTR Selector, then the game.
2. Select game language.
   - The bot used later can assist by selecting the "Mash A" option if set up early.
3. Continue playing until this screen appears.

## Step 3: Advancing the frames

Every time "No" is selected when confirming the name, one frame advances. This can be tedious, especially for higher target frames. A bot can automate frame advancement.

```
If a network connection is not available, manually fill in the tiny seeds.
```

1. Press the home button and wait for the internet to connect.
2. In 3DSRNGTool, go to Tools -> RNG Helper.
3. Fill in the IP address.
   - The IP address can be found on the Rosalina screen after enabling Input Redirection.
4. Open the Rosalina menu by pressing `L+Down+Select` and enable Input Redirection on the 3DS.
5. Click "One Click" in the RNG Helper window to connect.
   - This will fill in the tiny seeds.
   - This information can also be filled in manually.

6. Press "Calculate" in the main window to get a list of possible frames for RNG.
7. Adjust the range as needed.
8. If the target frame is too high or the TID/SID/TSV combination is not possible with your seed, reboot the system to start over with a different seed.
   - Rosalina can reboot quickly by pressing `L+Down+Select` and selecting the reboot option.

```
Soft resetting the game will hard lock the system!
```

In the RNG Helper window, fill in the starting and ending frames.

At this point, you can use the bot to advance frames or do it manually.

- The bot's speed depends on your 3DS's stability with your computer.
- Adjust the bot's speed to your liking.

The bot will stop 1 frame before the target frame.

- Name your character and confirm the selection.
- Wait until you can control your character to check if you got your TID/SID/TSV correct.

```
Press Start + Right then Select + Left to view TSV in the seventh party slot.
