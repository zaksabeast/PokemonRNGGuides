Introduction : This guide is more a fitting guide that is really important to make your life easier. You'll find some stuff not really related, some little points but they all will help you to make your life easier.

Ruby and Sapphire doesn't have a lot of tips compared to FRLG or Emerald since their power resides on the Live Battery method. However, we can list a few things that will still help you.

### Methods

* Stationary : Method 1
* Wild : Method H-1

```
Note : You might be hit by Vblank for wilds Mon and have some Method H-2 or H-4 showing up. However it's really rare.

### Trainer Card Flip

Doing a Trainer Card Flip in Gen 3 will always allow the game to reset the noise that created delay issues, making the user just to focus on the default delay. For that, you need to go to your trainer Card and press A. **It's a major thing that you should do by reflex.** To make it simple, just do it between 10k - 5k before your target frame. And with that, you'll save you a lot of trouble.


### How to avoid noise as much as possible

Based on the previous tip, a way to avoid vblank and noise as much as possible is just to be open your trainer card when you start your rng, do a flip, close it and advance to your target frame. It might seems simple, but it'll be an effective way to protect you from any bad surprise.

### How to advance frames faster

Compared to Emerald of Fire Red, Ruby / Sapphire lacks of a lot of solution to advance frames faster. However, like in any Gen 3 game, being in battle advances the frame two times faster. Always helpful especially for wild RNG.

### Did you know ? Painting Edition

Even if for Live Battery it's quite useless, Painting DOES work on Ruby / Sapphire.
