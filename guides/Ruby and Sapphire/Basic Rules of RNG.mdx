## Methods

1. Stationary: Method 1.
2. Wild: Method H-1.

```
Note: You might encounter Vblank issues with wild Pokémon, resulting in Method H-2 or H-4, but this is a rare occurrence.
```

## Intro

Ruby and Sapphire may have fewer tips than FRLG or Emerald due to the Live Battery method, but there are still valuable insights to share.

## Trainer Card Flip

In Gen 3, flipping your Trainer Card resets noise-related delays, helping you focus on the default delay. It's important to do this reflexively. Access your Trainer Card and press `A`. Try to do this between 10k-5k advances before your target advance. This can save you trouble.

## Minimizing Noise

To reduce vblank and noise issues, open your Trainer Card at the start of your RNG, perform a flip, close it, and then advance to your target. This simple strategy can protect you from unexpected surprises.

## Speeding Up RNG Advances

Ruby and Sapphire have limited options for speeding up RNG advances compared to Emerald, Fire Red, or Leaf Green. However, like any Gen 3 game, being in a battle doubles the RNG advancement speed, which is useful for wild Pokémon RNG.

### Painting RNG

Although it's not very useful for Live Battery, the Painting method does work in Ruby and Sapphire. As it's more advanced, it will be covered in a separate guide.
