## Hitting the Desired Frame

1. **Finding Delay**
   - Advance to the final screen before encountering the target Pokémon.
   - Make a save state ~100 frames before the encounter.

2. Press `A` when you land on your target frame to enter the encounter.
3. Use the period `.` key to advance by one frame when paused.
4. Take note of the IVs of the encountered Pokémon; they won't match the target Pokémon's IVs.
5. Open a new PokeFinder window and input the IVs of the encountered Pokémon.
6. To find the delay, subtract the frame hit from the desired frame.

`Delay = Frame Hit - Target Frame`

`Your new Target Frame = Desired Frame - Delay`

2. **Encountering the Pokémon**
   - Reload the previous save state before the encounter.
   - Advance to the new target frame.
   - If the Pokémon is not the desired one, find the new delay.
