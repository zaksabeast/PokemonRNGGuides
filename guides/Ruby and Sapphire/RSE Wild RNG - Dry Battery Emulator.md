You can copy on my FRLG guide for 90% of the part.
This guide is BEFORE the update with Real's scripts

This guide is to cover Fixed Initial Seed in Gen 3 aka RS dry and Emerald.

You need :

vba
Lua scripts (noob or project pokemon one)
PokeFinder

Open PokeFinder with the right profile and put the initial seed :

- 0 for Emerald
- 5A0 for Ruby / Sapphire dry.

Note : to have a dry ruby / sapphire just uncheck the real time clock in vba options.

Find a target, go to the place and save.

With PokeFinder (Gen 3 => Wild), just select the route and hit the criterias you want. For Ruby / Sapphire it's method H-1, for Emerald, it's method H-2 (you can still hit alternate spreads) once you've your target

Launch vba, do REGULAR save states. Once close to your frame do a calibration :

save state => note the frame you're on => encounter a pokemon with sweet scent => search that spread with pokefinder => do the math to find the delay and enter it in "delay box" => regenerate your target to have your new frame.

Once done go to your target frame; you'll hit what you want.

If not, just redo the calibration.
