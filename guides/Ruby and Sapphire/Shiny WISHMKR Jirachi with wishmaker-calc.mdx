## Tools

- [mGBA](/mgba-setup)
- [wishmaker lua script](https://github.com/Real96/PokeLua/blob/main/Gen%203/mGBA/RS_RNG_Checksums_mGBA.lua)

### Lua Script Set up

In line 6 of the lua script edit it to the path where your save is located.

```
local savePath = "D:\\Desktop\\mGBA\\battery\\Pokemon - Ruby.sav"  -- Write here the path of your Ruby/Sapphire save file
```

## Step 1: Finding Your Save Delay

1. Open Ruby/Sapphire and load the wishmaker lua script.
2. Open the save menu and pause the game at the last dialogue option over "YES".
3. Note the current time displayed by the lua script.
4. Hold down the `A` button and unpause the game simultaneously.
5. When the lua script time freezes, pause the game and write down that time.
   - Your save delay will be the time when it froze minus the time when you paused the game.
   - `Save delay = time froze - time paused`
6. Open the lua script in a text editor, like WordPad.
7. Input your save delay in the variables "savedelaySecond" and "savedelayFrame".

## Step 2: Hitting the Target Seed

1. Make sure RTC is disabled in emulator settings.
2. Open the lua script in WordPad (or a text editor).
3. Input the target time under targetSaveHour, Minute, Second, and sixtiethSecond.
4. Optionally, add your target Jirachi seed (for rng proofs/personal preference).
5. Restart the lua script. You will see two different times displayed.
6. The target save time is when you save to get the desired Jirachi.
7. The real save time is when you save, calculated using your save delay.
   - Target save time = Real save time + delay while saving.
8. Advance to the last dialogue of the save menu and hover over "YES".
9. Pause the game.
10. Wait for the in-game time to match the real save time displayed.
11. Unpause the game and stay close to the needed time.
12. Once near your real save time, pause and advance frames manually.
    - The default key for advancing frames is `Ctrl + N` for Windows.
13. When on your real save time, hold down `A` and unpause the game simultaneously (screenshot of the final screen below).
14. There should be "Current checksum:".
15. If the seed matches, congrats! Your save will redeem a shiny Jirachi!

## Troubleshooting

Double check and confirm RTC is disabled.

If your block 0 checksum does not match a shiny Jirachi seed, restart the process from the beginning.

Alternatively, you might have saved at the wrong time or incorrectly found your save delay.

## Methods to redeem Jirachi

You can redeem your Jirachi by moving your save file to a real cartridge and using a real bonus disc, or by emulating the bonus disc with Dolphin.

A guide on connecting VBA to Dolphin can be found [here](/misc-dolphin-connect-vba).
