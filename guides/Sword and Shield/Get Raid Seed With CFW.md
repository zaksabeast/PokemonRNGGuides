## Tools

- [CaptureSight](https://github.com/zaksabeast/CaptureSight/releases) or [PKHeX Raid Plugin](https://github.com/Leanny/PKHeX_Raid_Plugin)

## Method 1: Use CaptureSight

1. Start your game
1. Press the Home button and open CaptureSight
1. Look at the Active Den List and note which Den Ids are currently active
1. Go back to the game and save in front of your desired den
1. Use your wishing piece on the den
1. Press the Home button as fast as possible, before the game finishes saving
1. Load CaptureSight and go to the Active Den List
1. Find the new Den Id in the list
1. Close and reopen the game so it doesn't think the wishing piece was used

## Method 2: Use The PKHeX Raid Plugin

1. Use CFW or RCM to get your save file
1. Open the "main" file with PKHeX
1. Go to "Tools" => "Display Raids" to see all your raids
1. Search for a den you're interested in and get the den seed
1. Use RaidFinder with the den seed to find Pokemon you can RNG
1. If you don't find anything interesting, just re-use a Wishing Piece / check for naturals dens.
