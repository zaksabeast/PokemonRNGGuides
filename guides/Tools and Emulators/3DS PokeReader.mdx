## Tools

- [A 3DS with CFW (Custom Firmware)](https://3ds.hacks.guide/)

## Install PokeReader on 3DS

1. Download the [latest release of PokeReader](https://github.com/zaksabeast/PokeReader/releases/latest).
2. Create the `/luma/plugins` folder if it does not exist.
3. Copy `default.3gx` to the `/luma/plugins/` folder.
4. Open Rosalina (`L` + `Down` + `Select`) and enable the `Plugin Loader`.

## PokeReader Controls

- `Start` + `Up`: Opens and closes the overlay
