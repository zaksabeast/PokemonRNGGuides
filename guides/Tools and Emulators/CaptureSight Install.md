1. Download the latest release for both Tesla Menu and nx-ovlloader.
2. Unzip and merge folders onto the root of the SD card.

## Step 2: Install CaptureSight

## Troubleshooting

### dmnt:cht is not running

- If you see this error it is because you are not using Atmosphere (the Custom Firmware), or you have not installed it correctly. Follow [this guide](https://switchgui.de/switch-guide/extras/updating/) to update Atmosphere to the latest version.

### No cheat process! Is a game running? Is something else using dmnt:cht?

- Make sure to launch the game first before trying to run CaptureSight. Check that you are not also using sysbot-base. These two cannot be used at the same time as they conflict with each other.

### Unsupported game update!

- Updating the game to the latest version should fix this error.
- This error can also show if CaptureSight has not been updated for the latest game version.

### Unsupported game! Title Id: <titld_id>

- You are not using a game that CaptureSight supports. The list of supported games are:
  - Sword & Shield
  - Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl
