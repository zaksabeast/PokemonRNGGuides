## Troubleshooting

### dmnt:cht is not running

- If you see this error, you are not using Atmosphere (the Custom Firmware) or it is not installed correctly. Follow [this guide](https://switch.hacks.guide/extras/updating.html) to update Atmosphere to the latest version.

### No cheat process! Is a game running? Is something else using dmnt:cht?

- Make sure to launch the game first before trying to run CaptureSight. Check that you are not using sysbot-base, as these cannot run together due to conflict.

### Unsupported game update!

- Updating the game to the latest version should fix this error. This error can also occur if CaptureSight is not updated to the latest game version.

### Unsupported game! Title Id: \<title_id\>

- You are not using a game that CaptureSight supports. The supported games are:
  - Sword & Shield.
  - Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl.
