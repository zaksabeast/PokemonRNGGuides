## Delete a save file from a DS cartridge

Hold `Up + Select + B` on the title screen.

### Pokemon Ranger

For Pokemon Ranger, deleting the save file will not make it possible to claim another Manaphy Egg.

However, with a [Custom Firmware 3DS](https://3ds.hacks.guide/) it is possible to reset the cartridge entirely.

1. With Pokemon Ranger inserted, go to [FBI](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI/releases) -> titles -> game.
2. Go to erase save data and press `A`.
3. If you use [Checkpoint](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/Checkpoint/releases) to back up the save right before transferring the Manaphy Egg you can easily get the Manaphy Egg repeatedly.

## Delete a save file from a 3DS cartridge

Hold `Up + B + X` on the title screen.

## Delete a save file from an Nintendo Switch

1. Go to the HOME Menu and select "System Settings".
2. Scroll down and select "Data Management".
3. Choose "Delete Save Data".
4. Select the game title you want to delete the save data for.
5. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
