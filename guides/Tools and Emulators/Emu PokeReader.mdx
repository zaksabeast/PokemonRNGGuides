PokeReader is a plugin to help RNG on emulators.

For how to install PokeReader on a 3DS console, [go here](/install-pokereader).

## Tools

- [Lime3DS](https://github.com/Lime3DS/lime3ds-archive/releases/) or Citra

## Install PokeReader on Azahar/Lime3DS/Citra

1. Download the [latest release of PokeReader](https://github.com/zaksabeast/PokeReader/releases/latest).
2. Open the emulator's preferences.
3. Navigate to `System` settings.
4. Check the `Enable 3GX Plugin Loader` box.
5. Go to the `Storage` tab.
6. Click `Open` next to `SDMC Directory`.
7. Create the `/luma/plugins` folder if it does not exist.
8. Copy `default.3gx` to the `/luma/plugins/` folder.
9. Update your Pokémon games - PokeReader requires the latest version.

**We will update with more instructions once Azahar is released.**

## Troubleshooting

**PokeReader does not load and my game crashes!**

Make sure you have updated the game to the latest version. PokeReader will not work on older game versions.

[This guide](/citrarng-setup) has instructions for how to dump a game update from a CFW 3DS console.
