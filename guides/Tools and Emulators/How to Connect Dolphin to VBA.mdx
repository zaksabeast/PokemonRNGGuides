This link can be unstable and may not work 100% of the time due to timing inconsistencies between the two emulators. The performance of your PC could affect the success rate of the connection.
```

## Tools

- [VBA-M](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vbam/)
- Dolphin 5 (some other versions might work, Dolphin releases new versions frequently)
- GBA bios ([This is the Nintendo logo displayed during the start](http://imgur.com/byn7Kfb))

## Step 3: Establish the connection

1. When asked by the GameCube game to activate your GBA, import the battery file.

```
If the connection fails to establish immediately, try to restart the game or retry importing the battery file. If a connection is established but an error occurs, keep on trying.
```

2. After few restarts, the connection should succeed.
