## Tools

- A 3DS with CFW (Custom Firmware). Check out https://3ds.hacks.guide/ for instructions on installing CFW.

## Update Luma

Ensure your installed version of Luma3ds is 13.0 or later. Older versions aren't compatible with NTR.

- [Download Luma3ds](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases).  
  Download the `boot.firm` and overwrite the current `boot.firm` on the root of the SD card.

## Step 1: Installing NTR

First, install NTR by getting [BootNTR Selector](https://github.com/Nanquitas/BootNTR/releases).

- **N3DS and N2DSXL:** Download and install BootNTR Selector.  
  Download either of the CIAs that are _not_ Mode 3 and copy it to the SD card, then install using FBI.
- **O3DS and O2DS:** Download and install _BOTH_ BootNTR Selector and BootNTR Selector Mode 3.  
  Mode 3 is for Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon and Sun/Moon ONLY. Download one Mode 3 CIA and one regular CIA. Copy both CIAs to the SD card and install using FBI.

```
To install a CIA using FBI, launch FBI on the console, then navigate to the CIA file on the SD card and press `A` on it to install.
```

Launch BootNTR Selector and choose default for settings.

- Version 3.6 (replacing 3.4 and 3.5) is the only version that works for plugins, so choose it every time you boot NTR.
- **For O3DS and O2DS only:** Then launch BootNTR Selector Mode 3 and repeat the steps above.

## Step 2: Installing PCalc

After installing NTR, the next step is to install the PCalc plugin.

- [Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon](/downloads/pcalc/pcalc-usum.zip)
- [Sun/Moon](/downloads/pcalc/pcalc-sm.zip)
- [OR/AS](/downloads/pcalc/pcalc-oras.zip)
- [X/Y](/downloads/pcalc/pcalc-xy.zip)
- [Transporter](/downloads/pcalc/pcalc-tport.zip)

1. Download the .zip for the version you want and unzip its contents.
2. Move the plugin folder from the zip to the root of the SD card. Merge and overwrite contents if prompted.
3. You should now have a `Plugin` folder on the root of the SD card and two/four/six/eight folders inside it (depends on which PCalcs you downloaded) with a `cheat.plg` in each.

## Step 3: Launching PCalc

Launch BootNTR Selector and then the application of your choice.

- **O3DS and O2DS Only:** Launch BootNTR Selector Mode 3 for Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon and Sun/Moon ONLY.  
  Press the home button to return to the home screen, then launch Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon or Sun/Moon. Mode 3 should close ONLY when prompted to launch the game.

If the screen flashes green, congrats, you did it!

```
The PCalc Menu can be opened by pressing `X` + `Up` on the D-pad.

The NTR Menu can be opened by pressing `X` + `Y`. This is useful for taking screenshots; all screenshots are saved to the root of the SD card as .bmp files.
```

## Troubleshooting

If you updated to 3DS version 11.15 and NTR isnâ€™t working, make sure you have the latest BootNTR Selector and/or BootNTR Selector Mode 3, and a compatible Luma version for NTR.

- Hold `X` while launching to update easily.
- **O3DS and O2DS:** Update BOTH versions of BootNTR Selector.
- Check the section at the beginning of this guide for updating Luma for NTR.

If using Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon or Sun/Moon and PCalc displays `Init Seed` as 0:

- You are missing the v1.2 update for Sun and Moon or the v1.2 update for Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.  
  This can be downloaded from the Eshop or extracted from another console using CFW.

If using XY/ORAS and PCalc isn't working:

- Ensure you have the latest update for the game.  
  XY is 1.5, ORAS is 1.4. The game version can be found at the continue screen.  
  The update can be downloaded from the Eshop or extracted from another console using CFW.

If the game is updated to the latest version and PCalc and/or NTR isn't loading:

- Delete all NTR related files on the SD card.  
  Delete any NTR.bin files on the root of the SD card.  
  Delete these folders and their contents:
  - SD:/Nintendo 3DS/EBNTR/
  - SD:/3ds/ntr/
  - SD:/3ds/BootNTRSelector/
- Redownload the necessary NTR files by launching BootNTR Selector and BootNTRSelector Mode 3.

About Pokemon Gen 6/7 Game Updates:

- If you have a firmware region changed console or emunand, this can be obtained from other sources, such as dumping your update from another console, emunand, or sysnand.
- Pokemon game updates are not region locked.
- Cartridge and digital updates are stored on the SD card and are console/emunand specific, so they must be installed on the console/emunand you are using the game with.
