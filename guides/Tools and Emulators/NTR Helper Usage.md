```
Note: The computer and the 3DS must all be on the same internet connection for 3DSRNGTool to be able to connect.

NTR Helper can be found in 3DSRNGTool under the "Tools" tab in the upper right.
```

## Tools

- A 3DS with CFW (Custom Firmware) and NTR
- [3DSRNGTool](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/3DSRNGTool/releases)

## Gen 6 Connecting to 3dsrngtool

1. Press `X + Y` to bring up the NTR menu then select "Enable Debugger"
   - This is necessary for the console to stay connected to the internet after loading the game
2. Load the game while holding the `Left` button on the d-pad
   - The screen will flash three times then stop on the 3DS logo
3. In 3DSRNGTool go to `Tools -> RNG Helper`
4. Fill in the console IP address
5. Click "One Click" to connect in the RNG Helper window within 3DSRNGTool

## Gen 7 Connecting to 3dsrngtool

1. Press `X + Y` to bring up the NTR menu then select "Enable Debugger"
   - This is necessary for the console to stay connected to the internet after loading the game
2. Load the game and pause at the continue screen
   - Optionally you can connect while in the game later
   - If using a N3DS or N2DSXL you can press the home button to connect to the internet, then resume the game once connected to NTR Helper
   - If using an O3DS/O2DS, pressing the home button with NTR running will crash the console. This is why enabling the debugger in Rosalina allows the 3DS to stay connected to the internet
3. In 3DSRNGTool go to `Tools -> RNG Helper`
4. Fill in IP console address
5. Click "Connect" to connect in the RNG Helper window within 3DSRNGTool
