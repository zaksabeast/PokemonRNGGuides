## What is PokeReader?

**PokeReader** is a 3GX plugin (overlay) for the **Nintendo 3DS** that adds emulator-style tools to real hardware. It's used for **RNG manipulation** assisting in hitting perfect stats or shiny Pokemon easier.

To use PokeReader, your 3DS must have **Custom Firmware (CFW)** installed.

## What Can It Do?

With PokeReader, you can:
