## Tools

- A 3DS with CFW (Custom Firmware)
- [Instructions for installing CFW](https://3ds.hacks.guide/)

## Update Luma Settings

1. Boot the console while holding `Select`.
2. Select "Enable game patches".

## Offline Patch + PKSM Patch

This patch lets you use Transporter offline and keeps a stable delay for RNGing Pokémon from VC games. PKSM is needed as a destination for the transferred Pokémon.

1. Download the [code.ips file](https://github.com/zaksabeast/Transporter-Offline-Patch/releases) and copy it to the SD card at `/luma/titles/00040000000C9C00/code.ips`.
2. Open PKSM, enable "Edit during transfers", and create a new bank named `transport`.
3. Transfer Pokémon using Transporter.

```
Note: For more info, visit the [PKSM wiki](https://github.com/FlagBrew/PKSM/wiki/Storage).
```

### Troubleshooting

Q: Why does Transporter show, "At least one Pokémon remains in the Transport Box from your previous session"?

A: This may happen if:

- You don't have a PKSM bank named `transport`.
- You have Pokémon in Box 1 of your PKSM `transport` bank.
- Your PKSM `transport` bank is invalid.

## Cart Redirect Patch

This patch redirects Transporter and Dream Radar to use a .sav file on the SD card instead of a game cartridge. It lets you use saves from an emulator without needing to inject them.

1. Download and unzip the [zip file](https://github.com/zaksabeast/DreamRadarCartRedirect/releases).
2. Copy the IPS patch of your choice to the SD card.

- For Pokémon Transporter: `/luma/titles/00040000000C9C00/code.ips`.
- For Japanese Pokémon Dream Radar: `/luma/titles/0004000000073200/code.ips`.
- For All Regions Pokémon Dream Radar: `/luma/titles/00040000000AE100/code.ips`.

3. Make sure you have a save file at `/roms/nds/saves/white2.sav`, `/roms/nds/saves/black2.sav`, `/roms/nds/saves/black.sav`, or `/roms/nds/saves/white.sav`.

```
Note: If using [TWiLightMenu](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu), have a game file at `/roms/nds/white2.nds`, `/roms/nds/black2.nds`, `/roms/nds/black.nds`, or `/roms/nds/white.nds`.
```

```
Note: Black and White are only supported by Transporter.
```
