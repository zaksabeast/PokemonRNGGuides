## What are IPS Patches?

IPS patches are small files that change how a game runs without modifying the full ROM. Common patches include instant text, no outlines, or minor fixes. You can use them on real 3DS hardware or in emulators.

## Tools

- [A 3DS with CFW](https://3ds.hacks.guide/) OR [Azahar](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/releases/latest)
- The `code.ips` file that you want to use

## 3DS Instructions

### Update Luma Settings

1. Boot the console while holding `Select`.
2. Select "Enable game patches".

### Install the Patch

1. Find your game's title ID [using 3dsdb](http://www.3dsdb.com/).
2. Place your `code.ips` patch in `/luma/titles/_title ID_/code.ips`.

For example, Ultra Moon would be at `/luma/title/00040000001B5100/code.ips`.

## Azahar Instructions

2. Select "Open Mods Location" to open the mods folder.
