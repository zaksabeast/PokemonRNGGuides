## What are IPS Patches?

IPS patches are small files that change how a game runs without modifying the full ROM. Common patches include instant text, no outlines, or minor fixes. You can use them on real 3DS hardware or in emulators.

## Using IPS files with Luma

- You need Luma3DS installed on your 3DS.
- Instructions for installing Luma3DS: https://3ds.hacks.guide/

1. Find your game's title ID [using 3dsdb](http://www.3dsdb.com/).
2. Place your `code.ips` patch in `/luma/titles/_title ID_/code.ips`.

For example, Ultra Moon would be at `/luma/title/00040000001B5100/code.ips`.

## Using IPS files with Azahar/Lime3DS/Citra

1. Right click your game in Azahar.
2. Select "Open Mods Location" to open the mods folder.
3. Copy your `code.ips` into the mods folder.
