## Tools

- [mGBA (development build)](https://mgba.io/downloads.html#desktop-os-1)
- [Lua scripts](https://github.com/Real96/PokeLua/tree/main/Gen%203/mGBA)

## Set up lua script

1. Go to Tools -> Scripting...
2. Then File -> Load Script... and choose the lua script for your game version.

Every time you need to save or load a state, hold `Shift + (n)` or `(n)` with game unpaused.
This will load the save state to have the script read advances correctly.

- For example, `Shift + 1` to save a state in slot 1 or `1` to load the state in slot 1.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `attempt to call a nil value (method 'setWatchpoint')`

Make sure to use the development build of mGBA linked above. Other versions of mGBA will show this error.

### Error: `attempt to index a nil value (global 'emu')`

Make sure you have loaded a rom before attempting to run your lua script.
