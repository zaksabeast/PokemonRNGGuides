## Tools

- A 3DS with PokeReader ([PokeReader Install Guide](https://www.pokemonrng.com/install-pokereader))
- [Chatot](https://chatot.pokemonrng.com/#/gen6/transporter) or [3DSRNGTool](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Bambo-Rambo/3dsrngtool/build/artifacts)

## 3DSRNGTool Info

If using 3DSRNGTool, choose "Transporter" for the game version and select the "Stationary" tab.

You can utilize the index feature to check the spreads for all the generated Pokémon, enabling you to perform multiple RNGs simultaneously.

## Step 1: Ensure a Stable Delay

Set up the offline Transporter patch to ensure a stable delay by following the instructions [here](https://www.pokemonrng.com/transporter-patches).

## Step 2: Find a target advance

1. Make sure you have a Pokemon in Box 1, Slot 1 of your Gen 1/2 game.
1. Load Pokemon Transporter with PokeReader on your 3DS.
1. Open Chatot or 3DSRNGTool and enter the initial seed displayed by PokeReader.
1. Set the delay to 28.
1. In Transporter, press `Start` to select the game you would like to use with Transporter.
   - This is the final `A` press before Pokemon are generated.
1. Press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
1. Adjust the IV filters to find a desired spread.
   - Nature, ability, and shininess are determined in the Gen 1/2 game before Transporter.
1. Set the minimum advance to your current advance.
1. Set the maximum advance to the highest advance you want to search for spreads.
1. Click "Search".

All the displayed results are potential target advances. Choose your preferred one.

## Step 2: Hit the target

1. Unpause the game by pressing `Start`.
1. Wait at the game selection screen until you are close to the target advance.
1. When you are close, press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
1. Use `Select` to advance one by one until you reach the target advance.
1. Once you reach the target advance, press and hold `A`.
1. Check if you obtained the desired Pokemon. If not, do not transfer the Pokemon and try again.

```
Note: When asked if you want to transfer your Pokemon, clicking "No" will cause the Pokemon to be generated again. This allows for infinite retries in case you miss the RNG.
