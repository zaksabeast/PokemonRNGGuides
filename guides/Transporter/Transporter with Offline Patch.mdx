This guide allows for RNGing the IVs of Pokemon transferred from Gen 1/2 using Transporter. For a stable delay a patch is used to allow for transferring Pokemon without needing to connect to online servers. The Pokemon are still transferred the same as if the patch was not used.

Shininess and nature are predetermined in the Gen 1/2 game the Pokemon are coming from.

You can check the [nature table here](/misc-3ds-transporter-nature-tables) for what nature your Pokemon will have when transferred.

If you do not want to use the patch, you can follow the [Transporter RNG guide here](transporter-rng).

## Tools

- [A 3DS with PokeReader](/install-pokereader)

## Step 1: Ensure a Stable Delay

Set up the offline Transporter patch to ensure a stable delay by following the instructions [here](/transporter-patches).

## Step 2: Find a target advance

1. Make sure you have a Pokemon in Box 1, Slot 1 of your Gen 1/2 game.
1. Load Pokemon Transporter with PokeReader on your 3DS.
1. Enter the initial seed displayed by PokeReader into the tool below for "Seed".
1. Set "Delay" to 28.
1. In Transporter, press `Start` to select the game you would like to use with Transporter.
   - This is the final `A` press before Pokemon are generated.
1. Press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
1. Adjust the IV filters to find a desired spread.
   - Nature, ability, and shininess are determined in the Gen 1/2 game before Transporter.
1. Set the "Initial Advance" to your current advance.
1. Set the "Max Advances" to the highest advance you want to search for spreads.
1. Click "Search".

All the displayed results are potential target advances. Choose your preferred one.

## Step 2: Hit the target

1. Unpause the game by pressing `Start`.
1. Wait at the game selection screen until you are close to the target advance.
1. When you are close, press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
1. Use `Select` to advance one by one until you reach the target advance.
1. Once you reach the target advance, press and hold `A`.
1. Check if you obtained the desired Pokemon. If not, do not transfer the Pokemon and try again.

```
Note: When asked if you want to transfer your Pokemon, clicking "No" will cause the Pokemon to be generated again. This allows for infinite retries in case you miss the RNG.
