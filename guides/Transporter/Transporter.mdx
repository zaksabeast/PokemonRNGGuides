## Tools

- A 3DS with PCalc ([PCalc Install Guide](https://www.pokemonrng.com/misc-3ds-installing-pcalc))
- [3DSRNGTool](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/3DSRNGTool/releases)

## Useful note

```
When asked if you want to transfer your Pokémon, clicking "No" will cause the Pokémon to be generated again. This allows infinite retries if you miss the RNG.
```

## Step 1: Calibrate your delay

RNGing with Transporter has a delay between pressing `A` and Pokémon generation. The delay must be calibrated before RNGing.

1. Make sure you have at least one Pokémon in Box 1, Slot 1 of your Gen 1/2 game.
1. Load Pokémon Transporter with PCalc on your 3DS.
1. Open 3DSRNGTool on your computer.
1. Change 3DSRNGTool's "Game Version" to "Transporter."
1. Change 3DSRNGTool's "Seed" to the Initial Seed PCalc shows.
1. Change 3DSRNGTool's tab to "Stationary RNG."
1. In Transporter, press `Start` to select the game for Transporter.
1. Press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
1. Note your current frame; this is your starting frame.
1. Press `A` to unpause and let Transporter generate the Pokémon.
1. Search for the exact IVs PCalc indicates using 3DSRNGTool to find your hit frame.
1. Subtract your hit frame from your starting frame to get your delay.
   - Example: If you started on frame 1000 and hit frame 1197, your delay is 197.
1. When asked to transfer the Pokémon, click "No."
1. Repeat the process 5-10 times to get 5-10 delays.
1. Input the most frequent delay or an average into 3DSRNGTool's "Delay" box.

## Step 2: Find a spread to RNG

Follow these steps in 3DSRNGTool to find a desired spread:

1. Change the "Gender Ratio" to match the Pokémon you want to RNG.
1. Change the "Index of Target Pkm" to "1."
1. Change only the gender and IVs to find a spread you want.
   - Nature, ability, and shininess are determined in the Gen 1/2 game before Transporter.
1. Change the first "Frame Range" box to your current frame.
1. Change the second "Frame Range" box to the maximum frame you want to search.
1. Click "Search."

All results are potential wanted frames. Pick your favorite!

## Step 3: Hit the target

1. Using PCalc, wait at the game selection screen until you get close to your wanted frame.
1. Once close, press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
1. Press `Select` to advance the frames one by one until you reach your wanted frame.
1. Once at your wanted frame, press and hold `A`.
1. Check if you got the Pokémon you wanted; if not, don’t transfer your Pokémon and try again.

This may take several attempts.

## Alternative method with increased chances

Transporter generates 20 Pokémon at once. If you have 20 of the same Pokémon or cloned, you can have 20 chances to RNG the same Pokémon.

1. Catch 20 of the same Pokémon (or clone them).
1. Make sure all 20 are in Box 1 of your Gen 1/2 game.

In 3DSRNGTool:

1. Change the "Index of Target Pkm" to "1."
1. Change the "Filters" box to have the IVs you want to RNG.
1. Search for spreads using the initial seed PCalc shows.
1. Repeat this, adding 1 to the "Index of Target Pkm" to check the spreads for all 20 Pokémon.
1. Note the index with the most consecutive frames with spreads you want; this is your target index.
1. Ensure the number of consecutive frames is at least 10.
1. Set the "Index of Target Pkm" to your target index.
1. Get the list of delays from the calibration step.
1. Look for the highest delay within 10 frames of your most common delay.
1. In the "RNG Info" box of 3DSRNGTool, change "delay" to this new delay.
1. Press "Calculate" to find your potential frames with this new delay for your target index.
1. Find the highest frame among the 10+ consecutive frames from earlier and use it as your target frame.
