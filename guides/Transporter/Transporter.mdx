This guide allows for RNGing the IVs of Pokemon transferred from Gen 1/2 using Transporter. Shininess and nature are predetermined in the Gen 1/2 game the Pokemon are coming from.

You can check the [nature table here](/misc-3ds-transporter-nature-tables) for what nature your Pokemon will have when transferred.

If you would like a stable delay for easier RNG, you can follow the [Offline Patch Transporter RNG guide here](transporter-rng-offline).

## Tools

- [A 3DS with PokeReader](/install-pokereader)

## Useful note

```
When asked if you want to transfer your Pokémon, clicking "No" will cause the Pokémon to be generated again. This allows infinite retries if you miss the RNG.
```

## Step 1: Calibrate your delay

RNGing with Transporter has a delay between pressing `A` and Pokémon generation. The delay must be calibrated before RNGing.

1. Make sure you have at least one Pokémon in Box 1, Slot 1 of your Gen 1/2 game.
1. Load Pokémon Transporter with PokeReader on your 3DS.
1. Enter your Initial seed in the tool below.
1. In Transporter, press `Start` to select the game for Transporter.
1. Press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
1. Note your current advance; this is your starting advance.
1. Press `A` to unpause and let Transporter generate the Pokémon.
1. Search for the exact IVs PokeReader indicates using the tool below to find your hit advance.
1. Subtract your hit advance from your starting advance to get your delay.
   - Example: If you started on advance 1000 and hit advance 1197, your delay is 197.
1. When asked to transfer the Pokémon, click "No."
1. Repeat the process 5-10 times to get 5-10 delays.
1. Input the most frequent delay or an average into the "Delay" box.

## Step 2: Find a spread to RNG

Follow these steps with the tool below to find a desired spread:

1. Change the "Transporter Gender" to match the Pokémon you want to RNG.
1. Change IVs to find a spread you want.
   - Nature, ability, and shininess are determined in the Gen 1/2 game before Transporter.
1. Change the "Initial Advance" box to your current advance.
1. Change the "Max Advances" box to the maximum advance you want to search.
1. Click "Generate."

All results are potential wanted advances. Pick your favorite!

## Step 3: Hit the target

1. Wait at the game selection screen until you get close to your wanted advance.
1. Once close, press `Start + Select` to pause the game.
1. Press `Select` to advance one by one until you reach your wanted advance.
1. Once at your wanted advance, press and hold `A`.
1. Check if you got the Pokémon you wanted; if not, don't transfer your Pokémon and try again.

This may take several attempts.

## 20 Pokemon Method

Transporter generates 20 Pokémon at once. If you have 20 of the same Pokémon, you can have 20 chances at landing on the right advance.

1. Catch 20 of the same Pokémon (or clone them).
1. Make sure all 20 are in Box 1 of your Gen 1/2 game.

In the tool below:

1. Change the "Filters" box to have the IVs you want to RNG.
1. Search for spreads using the initial seed PokeReader shows.
1. Ensure the number of consecutive advances is at least 10.
1. Aim for the middle advance as your target advance.
