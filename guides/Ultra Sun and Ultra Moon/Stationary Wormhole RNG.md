## Tools

- A 3DS with CFW (Custom Firmware)
  - https://3ds.hacks.guide/ has instructions for installing CFW
- [3DSRNGTool](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/3DSRNGTool/releases)
- PCalc
  - [Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon](https://pokemonrng.com/downloads/pcalc/pcalc-usum.zip)
- [3DSRNGTool README](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/3DSRNGTool/blob/master/README.md#final-screen) - list of final screens before Pokemon are generated

```
Note: This method works for all Pokemon found within the wormholes, including Ultra Beasts.
```

## Step 1: Finding your seed

The seed is shown at the top of the overlay with the label of "Init Seed:". In the following image the seed is `5DA5CA91`.

## Step 2: Creating a timeline and finding a target frame

```
Note: When moving forwards to initiate the encounter, it is important to be precise in how you move the joystick forwards. Try to always move it in the same direction each time for more consistent results.
```

There are two methods that can be used for RNGing Pokemon in wormholes.

### Basic timeline with character fidgets

This method involves creating a timeline and accounting for character fidgets that occur within the timeline. The disadvatage to this method is the limited amount of frames that can be landed on due to being on a set timeline.

- For this method, follow the [timeline with fidget guide](https://www.pokemonrng.com/retail-usum-fidget) to create a timeline and find a target frame.

### Timeline leap

This method involves finding a target frame and then "leaping" onto the timeline needed to hit that frame. The advantage to this method is the ability to land on any frame regardless of which timeline it is on. Also, Festival Plaza can be used to advance frames much faster for shorter wait times.

- For this method, follow the [timeline leap guide](https://www.pokemonrng.com/retail-usum-timeleap) to find a target frame and leap onto it.

## Step 3: Hit your Target Frame

1. Now you can search for your target by entering what you are looking for in the filters and hitting calculate.

2. Advance near your frame and pause.

3. When you get to your frame it is time to initiate the encounter. For UBs this will be simply done by pressing "A" and for Legends you will want to hold forward and then press "A". You will want to save as close as possible to the spot that triggers the encounter.

4. Profit???
   - Not so much

So what happened?

This is okay and normal as each 3DS/save has its own delay that you will need to find. The delay is the time it takes from when you initiate the encounter and when the Pokemon actually gets generated by the game. Let's learn how to do that!

## Step 4: Finding your delay and hitting it

1. We can use the IVs, nature and PSV of the Pokemon we got to see what frame we actually hit. My target was 4973 and I hit 4969 (-4). So the delay I hit vs the default setting of the 3DSRNGTool is -4 or 152.

2. You will want to do this process a number of times with random targets and see what frame you hit relative to the default to find the delay you hit most often. You would then put that into the field after "Consider Delay". I adjusted the delay here to show how it would change the result.

```
Note: I did this as an example, wait until you have found a common delay until you change your delay. This can take 10-20 times or more depending on your results.
```

3. Once you find which delay is most consistent for you and enter it in to the field try for some harder targets! Here is the shiny Groudon I hit after finding my consistent delay of 152. Be aware that Legendary Pokemon can be a bit more inconsistent than UBs. This is because you have to take a step before the animation occurs adding more variables that could affect the delay.
