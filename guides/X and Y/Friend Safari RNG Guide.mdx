## Explanation of TinyMT frames within Tiny Timeline Tool

- **Main RNG Frame**: Main RNG frame ranges for each TinyMT frame listed. Manipulating the TinyMT timeline makes these frames overlap.
- **Enctr?**: Determines if there will be an encounter if the character turns or walks into the grass during those TinyMT seeds. The encounter must be under 13 (0-12) for guaranteed encounters.
- **Sync?**: Determines if nature will be synchronized.
  - `X` = No, `O` = Yes.
- **Slot**: Chooses which slot of Friend Safari will be used for the Pokémon.
  - Order matches the Friend Safari Pokémon screen from left to right.
- **HA**: Determines if Pokémon will have Hidden Ability or not.
  - `X` = No, `O` = Yes.

## Step 1: Set up

1. Load XY and connect to NTR Helper within 3DSRNGTool.
2. Enter the Friend Safari you wish to RNG in.
3. Walk to the left side of the area outside the grass and save.
   - You can now either do a test run or reset the game to use the reseeding method mentioned later in the guide to find a target frame.

```
Note: This guide assumes you already have basic knowledge of how to do Gen 6 RNG. It is recommended to first learn about Gen 6 RNG mechanics by RNGing something simple like eggs.
```

## Step 2: Manipulating TinyMT

To successfully cause an encounter on your target frame, manipulate the TinyMT with the following method. It’s good to practice manipulating the TinyMT first with test frames.

1. Choose a test frame as your target frame.
   - Search for any frame within the `Wild RNG` Tab of 3DSRNGTool.
   - Don't worry about nature if using Sync; this will be handled with TinyMT.
   - Right-click on the frame you want and select "Set as Target Frame."
2. In-game, step into the first grass tile.
3. Open the game menu with `X`.
   - This prevents your character from fidgeting and messing with the TinyMT timeline.
4. Click on `Tiny Timeline Tool` in the Wild RNG Tab of 3DSRNGTool.
   - Check the `Consider Delay` box and set delay to 6.
5. Click on `Calibrate` next to `Tiny Seeds` and wait for it to calibrate.
6. If the desired TinyMT frames do not overlap with the target frame, step out of the grass and back in, open the menu, then calibrate again.
   - Repeat until the TinyMT frames align with the target frame.
   - To advance TinyMT frames slightly, just turn in place instead of stepping.
   - For faster advancement, walk up and down the left side, since steps advance TinyMT frames quickly.
   - If you trigger an encounter, walk at least 5 steps after to enable another encounter. Remember this even after a successful RNG.

## Step 3: Hitting the Target Frame

1. To avoid random TinyMT index advancement (+2), close the menu during your target's index. Pause the game with `Start + Select`.
   - Advance frame by frame by pressing `Select` until you're on your target frame.
   - Ensure you're standing on a grass tile while doing this.
2. Unpause with `A` and turn in any direction with the D-Pad to trigger the encounter.
3. Calibrate a delay if needed, but delay of 6 should work for Friend Safari if you turn, and 14 if you step.

## Reseeding Method

Once you can manipulate the TinyMT to reach a target frame, you can look for higher frames. Using NTR Helper and reseeding helps find a target frame faster.

1. Load XY and connect to NTR Helper within 3DSRNGTool.
   - Press `One Click` in NTR Helper to connect and grab the initial seed.
   - Directions on how to do this can be found in the NTR Helper Usage link above.
2. Press `A` to reach the continue screen. This is when the seed is set.
3. Search for frames using that seed. If you find nothing appealing, reseed.
   - Press `B` then `A` to back out of the continue menu and return to it.
   - This refreshes the initial seed each time.
4. Repeat until you find a desirable frame.
5. Continue the save, manipulate the TinyMT, and trigger the encounter on the target frame to get the Pokémon you want.

```
Note: Frames advance twice as fast in a battle, so you can battle to advance many frames, then manipulate the TinyMT. Allow extra time for this in case you miss your target frame while aligning the TinyMT frames.
```
