## Tools

- [PokeReader](/install-pokereader)
- Lots of repels to avoid wild Pokémon encounters

## Step 1: Setting Up

1. Ensure you have PokeReader installed and running.
2. Open PokéReader and lock it in place by pressing `X` and `Y`.
3. Use the PokeRadar and encounter the Pokemon you want to be shiny.
4. Knock out or catch the Pokémon to start the chain of 1 and lock the species.
   - Chain 0 patches are not determined the same as chain 1 or higher. You must randomly encounter a Pokemon or use Wild RNG to get your species.

```
Note: Avoid using roller skates, running into the wrong species, or stepping into empty patches - these will break your chain.
```

## Step 2: Inputting Data

1. Open your bag to pause TinyMT advancements.
2. Enter the following data from PokeReader into the RNG tool at the bottom of this guide:
   - TinyMT seeds
   - Current advances
   - Max advances (e.g., 20,000)
   - Number of Pokémon in your party
   - Chain count
3. Click "Generate" to display possible results.

When you click on a row in the tool you'll see shown below the results:

- **Sparkles**: Shiny Pokémon patches.
- **Green checkmarks**: Safe patches that continue your chain.
- **Red crosses**: Dangerous patches that break your chain (wrong species or empty).

## Step 3: Advancing TinyMT

1. Walk around to recharge the PokéRadar if needed.
2. Use Pokémon Amie to advance TinyMT quickly.
3. Open your bag to pause advancements when you are close to your target advance.
4. Advance to your target by
   - Toggling the Experience Share to advance by 3 for each Pokémon in your party.
   - Start teaching a Pokémon a TM and quickly exit to advance by 1.

## Step 4: Finding the Shiny Patch

1. Once you've reached your target advance, use PokeRadar.
2. Walk into the correct patch without breaking the chain.
3. Catch your shiny Pokémon!

Congrats—you've successfully RNGed a shiny Pokémon!
