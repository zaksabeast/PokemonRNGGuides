So first the basics, you'll need :

- Desmume (any version even if 9.11 is more stable)
- Lua Scripts (Noob forums is the best for that here)
- PokeFinder
- A Sweet Scenter
Optionnal : A lead.

Before, you must know how to hit an initial seed. You can check the right guide for that

So first, find your target. Save on the area. 

Open PokeFinder : Gen 4 => Wild. Go on Searcher tab (important /!\) select or create your profile. After select the route and enters the wanted parameters.
Since it's DPPt, it's method J and not method L. Take care of this !
Don't hesitate to use leads to give more possible frames.
/!\  The delay can be high same with the frames /!\

Once you have a target frame, right click on it and "Generate times for seed"

Open your emulator and load your lua script. Hit the initial seed.

Open your menu with X. From that you've some ways to advance PIDRNG Frames :

- Chatot (x2 prefered) with chatter activated. If it's not working just use the record of desmume to get it working, it'll advance frames.
- NPC (advance them random)
- Journal (advance by 2 if you have a "[pokemon] was caught!"

Once on the right frame, just use your Sweet Scenter and tada you're good to go !
