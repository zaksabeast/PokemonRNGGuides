# Live Battery Ruby/Sapphire Stationary RNG Guide (Emulator)

This method will work on any Pokemon generated by Method 1 in Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire. Keep in mind that if you're looking for an specific spread to be shiny, ID/SID abuse might be required before attempting this RNG.

### What you'll need for this RNG
  - [VBA-RR v23.6 (svn 480)](https://code.google.com/archive/p/vba-rerecording/downloads)
  - [GBA bios file](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=gba%20bios)
  - [Latest Version of RNGReporter](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Admiral-Fish/rngreporter/build/artifacts)
  - A Ruby or Sapphire ROM with a new game
  - [Ruby/Sapphire Lua Scripts](https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/15187-gen-3-lua-scripts/)
  
### Settings
Before attempting this:
  - Make sure the save mode is set correctly (Options > Emulation > Save Type > Automatic & Flash 128K).
  - Load and use the BIOS (Options > Emulation > Use BIOS file & Select BIOS file...) with "Skip BIOS" disabled.
  - Real Time Clock must be enabled in order to obtain Live Battery seeds.
  - (**Recommended**) You can also disable the audio (Options > Audio > Disable)
  
### Additional resources
  - [PKHeX](https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/29182-pkhex-gen-1-7-savpkm-editor/) to edit Gen 3 files
  - [E-reader Eon Ticket](https://digiex.net/threads/pokemon-gen3-e-reader-eon-ticket-save-file-download-ready-to-distribute-on-emulator.15233/) to gain access to Southern Island in R/S
  
## Generating the Seed

1. Open RNG Reporter and go to 4th Gen Tools > Calculate PID from IVs. Enter the IVs you are looking for on the Pokemon you want to obtain. On my case, I will be RNG abusing this spread shiny on my Sapphire game. My TID has been RNG abused already, so I only need to find a seed that will generate my spread. Make sure you right click

2. Now go to 3rd Gen Tools > PID to IVs. Copy the PID on the PID (Hex) box and click on Generate. Since we are looking for a Method 1 spread, make sure you copy the seed of the spread with the IVs you wanted (Right click > Copy Seed to Clipboard).

3. Go to 3rd Gen Tools > 16-Bit Seed to Time. Remember the 32 bit seed you copied earlier? Enter it on the 16/32-Bit Seed tab. Use 2000 as the year (Live Battery). Now click on Find.

4. RNG Reporter will list all possible date/time combinations that will give you the seed that will generate your desired spread. All we have to do is hit our initial seed on time and find the frame where our spread is generated.

5. Take note of the date and the time you will use to get the required seed. On my case, this means that I have to start my RS game on February 29, 2000 at 11:49 AM. Unlike Gen 4, delay does not matters at all on this case so the seconds you take to boot your game are irrelevant as long as you get to the Continue screen at 11:49 AM on the specified date.

## Start

1. Launch the emulator, go to Tools > Lua Scripting > New Lua Script Window and load the .lua file whenever you start the game

2. Change your computer's date and time to the one shown on the 16 Bit Seed to Time window. Make sure you turn on the game on the exact minute specified on it. The delay on the seconds do not matter at all. (11:49:00 AM - 11:49:59 AM).

3. Make sure you have saved in front of the Legendary Pokemon you want to RNG abuse so that you only have to press A to trigger the encounter or you are one step away from activating the event. Below you can see some examples.

4. On the main tab of RNG Reporter enter the 16 bit seed you received along with all the necessary info. Click on generate and find on what frame your spread is generated. On my case, it is generated at frame 174039

5. Let the game run at full speed if required. Your frame counter will increase on its own. Do not hesitate to make save states along the way, just in case.

6. When you are nearing your target frame (let's say 500-1000 frames off), create a new save state and pause the emulator.

7. There is a frame drift that occures between the moment you initiate combat and the moment the Pok√©mon is generated. In order to compensate for this drift, we will have to manually calculate it.
  - To calculate this drift, I recommend pausing the emulator on a closed number (ex: 110000 frames), then press A to trigger the encounter and find the frame you hit. After this, subtract the visual frame - frame shown in RNG Reporter. The difference should be the frame drift advanced before the encounter.

On Latios case, the drift is of 160 frames, so all what I have to do is subtract 174039 - 160 = 173879.

8. Advance until you reach your new target frame, pause the emulator again and hold the A button. Unpause the emulator and hit your shiny frame! If you did everything right, you should be able to hit your desired spread on your Pokemon. If not, calculate how many frames you are off, reload a previous save state, adjust accordingly, and try again.

9. Capture your Shiny Legend :).
