# Live Battery Stationary Abuse (Ruby/Sapphire)
---

---
## Tools
---

- [VBA-RR](https://github.com/TASVideos/vba-rerecording/releases)
- [PokeFinder](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/PokeFinder/releases)
- [The Ruby/Sapphire Lua Scripts for your language](http://pokerng.forumcommunity.net/?t=56443955)
    - Password for the lua script archive is `allyouneedisnoob`.
- [runasdate (Optional)](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_as_date.html)
- A save file that has been ID abused. 
    - Optional but recommended if going for shiny spreads with good IVs.

```
Note: This method will work on any Pokemon generated by Method 1 in Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire. Keep in mind that if you're looking for an specific spread to be shiny, ID/SID abuse might be required before attempting this RNG.
```

---
## VBA-RR Settings
---

- Make sure the save mode is set correctly.
    - Options > Emulation > Save Type > Automatic & Flash 128K

- Real Time Clock must be enabled in order to obtain Live Battery seeds.
    - Options > Emulation > Real Time Clock
    - If there are errors when loading past the title screen, such as corrupted save or dead battery message, restart VBA for the changes to take effect.

## Ruby/Sapphire PID/IV combinations
---

- This guide only applies to Ruby and Sapphire RNG.
  - Fire Red and Leaf Green have random seeding and Emerald will always have the initial seed of 0 unless you didn't soft reset or turn off the game.

- Also, spreads are limited due to the limited amount of valid PID/IV combos. You can read about PID generation more in-depth [here](https://www.smogon.com/ingame/rng/pid_iv_creation).
  - Because of the limited amount of PIDs that are linked with a good IV spread, it is recommended that you attempt an ID abuse before attempting to get a shiny 5IV Pokemon (or any specific Shiny/IV combo).

---
## Generating the Seed
---

1. Find your spread that you want to hit.

    - Choose "Gen 3 Stationary" and click the "Searcher" tab. Input the spread you want and look for results.

    - If there are no results, adjust filters until there is a result that you want.

    - Input your chosen spread to get the seed and PID. Make sure it says Method 1!

2. Getting your Initial Seed

    - The seed you got from that screen was simply the seed you must hit when you press `A` on encounter.

    - To get your initial seed, right click on the seed you are using and choose "Generate times to seed".

    - The seed will automatically be added into "16-Bit Seed To Time".

    - Make sure the year is set to 2000 as other years will not work correctly.

    - This will give you your initial seed and the date and time needed to hit your desired seed.

3. Finding the Frame to hit

    - On the screen of PokeFinder below enter your initial seed and spread. Make sure that it is set to search "Method 1". It should look something like this:

- Hit "Generate" and look for results. If you don't get a result, try extending the max results to a higher number.

---
## Hitting the Desired Seed and Frame
---

1. Hitting the Initial Seed
    - Open runasdate (or change your computer clock) and set the date to one listed in "16-Bit Seed To Time". 
    - If you are using runasdate set up the screen just like how it is shown below:

    - Note that unlike Generations 4 and 5, only the hours and minutes matter for hitting the initial seed.

    - Hit run and you will open VBA-RR. 

    - Load the lua script for your game.

2. Finding Delay

    - Advance to the final screen before encountering the target Pokemon making save states along the way.

    - When you land on your target frame press `A` and enter the encounter.

    - Take note of the IVs of the Pokemon you encounterd.

    - Now, open a new PokeFinder and input your initial seed and the IVs of the Pokemon encountered.

    - Since I hit `A` on Frame 89016 that means 54 Frames went by between my last input (hitting `A`) and the IVs and PID being generated.

    - Therefore, to hit my 31/2/31/31/31/31 Modest spread, I must hit frame 180124.

    - Target Frame = Desired Frame - Delay

3. Advance Frames

    - Advance frames paying attention to the frame count so you don't miss your target frame.

    - Advance until you reach your new target frame, pause the emulator again and hold the `A` button.

    - Unpause the emulator and hit your shiny frame! 
    
    - If you did everything right, you should be able to hit your desired spread on your Pokemon. If not, calculate how many frames you are off, reload a previous save state, adjust accordingly, and try again.

4. Enjoy your new Pokemon!
