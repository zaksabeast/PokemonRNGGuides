Step 1: Generate your TID and list of possible SIDs
    
    Offset for TID/SID generation: XXX

    Timer

    Obtained TID: XXX

    Estimated time to determine SID for that TID: 140 min (Very good/Very bad)
    Recommendation: Redo Step 1 to generate a new easier TID (~10% chance that each new TID is significately better)
    Recommendation: Keep that TID and go to Step 2.

    Possible SIDs: 
        

Step 2: Determine which SID is the correct one
