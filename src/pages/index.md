In Pokemon, there are lots of random events that occur:

- Which wild Pokemon will you encounter
- What stats will your legendary have
- Will you breed a shiny Pokemon

However computers and consoles canâ€™t create random numbers; only random-looking numbers.

Often times these algorithms are repeatable, and we can recreate those game mechanics on our computers. In this way, we know exactly when to carry out an action, such as pressing the `A` button, to start a Pokemon battle and get the exact results we want.

RNG abuse is when players abuse a Pokemon game's random number mechanics to encounter any wild Pokemon, a legendary with any stats, or even breed a shiny Pokemon with the press of a button.
