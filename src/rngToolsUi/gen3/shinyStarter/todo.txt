I got a question about how to design my shiny starter tool.

In summary, it's split in 3 sub-components:

1- FindTargetAdv:
  Input: Species, TID, SID
  Output: Earliest advance for shiny

2- Timer
  Input: Earliest advance for shiny
  Visual: Timer

3- CaughtMon
  Input from previous sub-components: Earliest advance for shiny, TID, SID
  New Input: Caught Pokemon stats, nature, gender.
  Output: Most probable advance of the caught Pokemon

Here how I plan to structure it:

ShinyStarter: A React component that embeds all 3 sub-components.
  Props: None
  State: State for entire component (Species, TID, SID, targetAdv (earliest adv for shiny); Caught Pokemon stats, nature, gender, results)
  Children: FindTargetAdv, ShinyTimer, CaughtMon

FindTargetAdv:
  Props:
    Species, TID, SID, SetSpecies, SetTID, SetSID
    setTargetAdv (triggered when pressing submit)
  State: None

ShinyTimer:
  Props: targetAdv, latestHitAdv
  State: None
  Children: MysticTimer

ShinyTimer:
